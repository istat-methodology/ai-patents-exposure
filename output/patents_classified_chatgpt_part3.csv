A software modernization system includes a software analysis service that obtains, for one or more software applications undergoing evaluation, a collection of application artifacts, application profiling metrics, and other application profile data. A collection of features is extracted from the application artifacts and metrics and used as input to a ML model trained to determine whether a software application likely is monolithic.",251,"['252', '351']"
