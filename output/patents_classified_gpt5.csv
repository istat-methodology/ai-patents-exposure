US-7236831-B2,Methods and apparatus for effectuating a lasting change in a neural-function of a patient ,2000,"The present disclosure suggests methods of selecting a stimulation site for stimulating a patient's brain or methods of effectuating a neural-function of a patient associated with an impaired body function. In one exemplary implementation, such a neural function may be effectuated by selecting a stimulation site, positioning at least a first electrode at the stimulation site, and applying an electrical potential to pass a current through the first electrode. If one aspect, this stimulation site may be selected by a) identifying a second body function that is a corollary to the impaired body function, and b) determining a corollary location of the patient's brain that is associated with the second body function and is ipsilateral to the impaired body function.",221,Medical Doctors,"['226', '215', '321']"
US-6795826-B2,Fuzzy content network management and access ,2000,A system and a method for managing information encapsulates the information as objects. The objects are related by a degree to other objects in a content network. The relationships between the objects may be established and enhanced by various human or automatic means. An attractive user interface facilitates use and management of the network by many users. Access to the content network may be customized for distinct user groups.,251,Software and Applications Developers and Analysts,"['252', '351', '133']"
US-6941294-B2,"Method and apparatus for digital media management, retrieval, and collaboration ",2000,"A system stores digital media records, and comprising a vocabulary file of words keyed to the digital media records. A search query is received by computer from a user, the search query including words. The search query is logged by computer, yielding a query log. The query log is processed by computer to identify words in the query log which are not words already included in the vocabulary file and which are not words which are variants of words already included in the vocabulary file. Such words are defined as â€œnot-found words.â€ The not-found words are added to the vocabulary file, and the not-found words are keyed to the digital media records.",251,Software and Applications Developers and Analysts,"['252', '262', '264']"
US-7176482-B1,DNA-based electronics ,2000,"Digital computational circuit comprising a network made of a plurality of identical repetitive DNA-based conductive elements. The DNA-based elements used for the purposes of the invention employ a P-bridge as a tunnel junction for a net charge. The DNA-based element of which the circuit is made may be a DNA SET transistor. The circuit may comprise a DNA resistor built from a plurality of SET transistor elements a series, with a constant over-threshold gate voltage. The circuit may further comprise NOT and NOR gates. The NOT gate can be made of a DNA-based transistor and a resistor, and the resistor can be made by using a DNA SET transistor with a constant over-threshold gate voltage, and by placing a plurality of such DNA SET transistors in series until the resistivity reaches the desired value. The NOR gate, on the other hand, can be built from two NOT elements wherein the output of the first NOT element is connected to the resistor of the second NOT element as it voltage supply.",215,Electrotechnology Engineers,"['214', '213', '211']"
US-7487106-B2,System and method for managing mobile workers ,2000,"A computer implemented system and method for managing mobile workers in an object oriented programming environment is disclosed. A plurality of target objects that correspond to facilities assets to be worked on by a mobile worker are classified within a database of the computer. The attributes of each target object are defined, including a task to be performed on each target object. Mobile workers are scheduled for the tasks to be performed on target objects by running a rule engine to determine the algorithms and heuristics to be used to schedule mobile workers for the tasks to be performed. The scheduled jobs are then output to the mobile workers.",251,Software and Applications Developers and Analysts,"['252', '133', '351']"

US-7200612-B2,processing data for interpretation ,2000,"A system for improving sensor-based decision making provides for the automatic submission of data obtained locally from instrumentation (such as image data) together with the interpretation of that data, which can be the output of some software which has been checked and possibly corrected by a user according to his/her expertise, to a remote database via an internetwork. The submission to the remote database is preferably automatic so that the remote database grows over time. The local site can access the remote database to retrieve information to assist in interpretation of the locally produced data (for example similar images and their corresponding interpretations), or can retrieve updated or improved software or parameters improving the software used for processing the data. The information on the remote database can also be reprocessed by software agents to provide statistical information based on information from a variety of such local sites. The system is particularly useful in improving the interpretation of data which is difficult to interpret such as medical image data (e.g. mammographic or cardiac ultrasound data).",251,Software and Applications Developers and Analysts,"['252', '221', '321']"
US-6840107-B2,Acoustic microscope ,2000,An acoustic microscope is disclosed having an acoustic lens formed of fused metal and glass. A high speed analogue to digital converter and a pulse generator/receiver are also disclosed. Automated V(z) curve measurement produces quantitative elastic properties of the specimen.

US-6665377-B1,Networked voice-activated dialing and call-completion system ,2000,"A networked system of voice-activated dialers is described. When a calling party using a local voice-activated dialer utters a phrase which indicates that information to reach a called party may be available at a remote site, a network connection is established to the remote site, spoken words or phrases are transmitted to the remote site, and the called party information is obtained from the remote site. The called party information is used to provide additional networked services to the calling party such as call-completion, voice messaging, or paging. These additional networked services may use the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and an existing signaling network such as the Signaling System No. 7 network.",215,Electrotechnology Engineers,"['251', '252', '352']"
