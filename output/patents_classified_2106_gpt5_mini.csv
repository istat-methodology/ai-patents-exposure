It is based on the Adaptive Resonance Theorem and Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Map neural models. In the adaptive training of the DC model, an input data file is vectorized into a domain of same size vector subunits. The result of the training (step10to34) is to cluster the input vector domain into classes of similar subunits, and develop a center of mass called a centroid for each class to be stored in a codebook (CB) table. In the compression process, which is parallel to the training (step33), for each input subunit, we obtain the index of the closest centroid in the CB. All indices and the CB will form the compressed file, CF. In the decompression phase (steps42to52), for each index in the CF, a lookup process is performed into the CB to obtain the centroid representative of the original subunit. The obtained centroid is placed in the decompressed file. The compression is realized because the size of the input subunit ((8 or 24)*n2bits) is an order of magnitude larger than its encoding index log2[size of CB] bits. In order to achieve a better compression ratio, LZW is performed on CF (step38) before storing (or transmitting) it.",251,"['252', '212']"

Existing techniques tend to either fail when echo return loss is very low or require highly complex algorithms to increase the range of detecting whether double-talk is occurring. The invention is based upon a new method of estimating the power envelope of the double-talk signal. This estimation is then employed in conjunction with a slightly modified version of an echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) based statistic, to form a double-talk decision based on a combination of the two statistics. The resulting decision rule works for both low-ERLE and high-ERLE situations, which is useful when there can be large variations in the magnitude of the echo path seen by the algorithms, or where near-end noise prevents the achievement of high ERLE.",215,"['251', '352']"
