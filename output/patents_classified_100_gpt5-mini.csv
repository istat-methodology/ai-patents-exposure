This map is analyzed by means of a pitch analyzer to obtain a pitch line over time, the pitch line indicating a pitch of the sound signal for respective time instants. A rhythm analyzer is operative for analyzing envelopes of estimates for selected inner hair cells, the inner hair cells being selected in accordance with the pitch line, so that segmentation instants are obtained, wherein a segmentation instant indicates an end of the preceding note or a start of a succeeding note. Thus, a human-related and reliable sound signal analysis can be obtained.;251;Software and Applications Developers and Analysts;['214', '215', '211']
US-7428529-B2;Term suggestion for multi-sense query ;2004;Systems and methods for related term suggestion are described. In one aspect, term clusters are generated as a function of calculated similarity of term vectors. Each term vector having been generated from search results associated with a set of high frequency of occurrence (FOO) historical queries previously submitted to a search engine. Responsive to receiving a term/phrase from an entity, the term/phrase is evaluated in view of terms/phrases in the term clusters to identify one or more related term suggestions.;251;Software and Applications Developers and Analysts;['252', '264']

US-8301788-B2;Deterministic finite automata (DFA) instruction ;2004;A computer-readable instruction is described for traversing deterministic finite automata (DFA) graphs to perform a pattern search in the in-coming packet data in real-time. The instruction includes one or more pre-defined fields. One of the fields includes a DFA graph identifier for identifying one of several previously-stored DFA graphs. Another one of the fields includes an input reference for identifying input data to be processed using the identified DFA graphs. Yet another one of the fields includes an output reference for storing results generated responsive to the processed input data. The instructions are forwarded to a DFA engine adapted to process the input data using the identified DFA graph and to provide results as instructed by the output reference.;251;Software and Applications Developers and Analysts;['252', '351']
AT-E471558-T1;TRAINING SYSTEM OF A NEUROEVOLUTION ;2004;Artificial bandwidth expansion devices, systems, methods and computer code products are disclosed for expanding a narrowband speech signal into an artificially expanded wideband speech signal. Embodiments of the invention can operate by forming an unshaped wideband signal based on the narrowband speech signal, such as through aliasing, and shaping the wideband signal into the artificially expanded wideband speech signal by amplifying/attenuating the unshaped wideband signal using a function generated by a neural network. Weights of the neural network can be set by a training/learning subsystem which generates genomes containing the neural network weights based on simulated environments in which a device employing the artificial bandwidth expansion is expected to operate.;251;Software and Applications Developers and Analysts;['215', '214', '252']

US-8913800-B2;Optical biometrics imaging with films ;2004;Methods and systems are provided for performing a biometric measurement on an individual. A purported skin site of the individual is illuminated under a plurality of distinct optical conditions during a single illumination session. Light scattered beneath a surface of the purported skin site is received separately for each of the plurality of distinct optical conditions. A multispectral image of the purported skin site is derived from the received light. A biometric function is performed with the derived multispectral image.;215;Electrotechnology Engineers;['251', '214']
US-7457874-B2;Architecture for controlling access to a service by concurrent clients ;2004;Architecture for controlling access to a service. The architecture allows denial of regular and periodic service to all but a selected number of concurrent clients associated with a subscriber, and without any manual administration at the server of a list of specific computers. Rather than require an administered list, the system discovers which clients are active, places the active clients on an active list, and excludes all client not on the active list. The system includes rules the enforcement of which provide a mechanism for ensuring that the subscriber is not adding an unlimited number of clients or rotating clients in and out of the pool to effectively maintain service on a larger number of computers to which the subscriber is entitled.;251;Software and Applications Developers and Analysts;['252', '351']
