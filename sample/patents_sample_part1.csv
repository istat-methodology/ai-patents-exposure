US-6751601-B2;Method and a system for solving dynamic problems using the dynamical system architecture ;2000;The invention consists of a learning system (108) based on the Dynamical System Architecture (DSA). Every implementation of the DSA is composed of a dynamic system (112) and a static system (116). The dynamic system (112) generates an intermediate output (114), which together with an external input (100) is fed into the static system (116), which produces a generated output (106). Every time the dynamic system (112) is reset it produces the same trajectory: an intermediate output (114) that does not cross over itself during the temporal span of each of the events generated by a reference system (102) whose behavior has to be duplicated. The static system (116) can be anything that behaves like a trainable universal function approximator. Training uses the intermediate output (114), the external input (100), the observed output (104) produced by the reference system (102) whose behavior is going to be mimicked, and a self-organizing procedure that only modifies the parameters of the static system (116).

After the dictionary compression method produces an intermediary output data file, the intermediary output data may be separated into multiple sections, and a compression method that is potentially suitable for the data characteristics of each section may be applied. The compressed results of each section are then combined to produce the final output.

US-6513022-B1;Dynamic programming network ;2000;A dynamic programming network integrating sensor management, sensor fusion, and an application in a seamless structure in which these functions are mutually dependent and develop autonomously and concomitantly with experience. The dynamic programming network autonomously divides these functions into multiple subtasks that it can assign to the processors of a fine-grained parallel computer. As the number of processors available for these subtasks increases the network may attain its objective more efficiently. This architecture confers the greatest advantage in feature-rich applications such as identification of targets in synthetic aperture radar, visual, and infrared images. The design can be extended, however, to such diverse and general applications as control problems and machine intelligence. For the pattern recognition applications, the dynamic programming network detects, selects, and identifies features and patterns comprising those features via a series of observations rather than processing all data available in each image, thereby minimizing sensor usage and volume of data processed. The network remembers similar features contained in many images instead of many images containing similar features, thus conserving memory and facilitating data retrieval.

US-6766320-B1;Search engine with natural language-based robust parsing for user query and relevance feedback learning ;2000;A search engine architecture is designed to handle a full range of user queries, from complex sentence-based queries to simple keyword searches. The search engine architecture includes a natural language parser that parses a user query and extracts syntactic and semantic information. The parser is robust in the sense that it not only returns fully-parsed results (e.g., a parse tree), but is also capable of returning partially-parsed fragments in those cases where more accurate or descriptive information in the user query is unavailable. A question matcher is employed to match the fully-parsed output and the partially-parsed fragments to a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) stored in a database. The question matcher then correlates the questions with a group of possible answers arranged in standard templates that represent possible solutions to the user query. The search engine architecture also has a keyword searcher to locate other possible answers by searching on any keywords returned from the parser. The answers returned from the question matcher and the keyword searcher are presented to the user for confirmation as to which answer best represents the user's intentions when entering the initial search query. The search engine architecture logs the queries, the answers returned to the user, and the user's confirmation feedback in a log database. The search engine has a log analyzer to evaluate the log database to glean information that improves performance of the search engine over time by training the parser and the question matcher.

US-6608924-B2;Neural network model for compressing/decompressing image/acoustic data files ;2001;A new neural model for direct classification, DC, is introduced for acoustic/pictorial data compression. It is based on the Adaptive Resonance Theorem and Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Map neural models. In the adaptive training of the DC model, an input data file is vectorized into a domain of same size vector subunits. The result of the training (step10to34) is to cluster the input vector domain into classes of similar subunits, and develop a center of mass called a centroid for each class to be stored in a codebook (CB) table. In the compression process, which is parallel to the training (step33), for each input subunit, we obtain the index of the closest centroid in the CB. All indices and the CB will form the compressed file, CF. In the decompression phase (steps42to52), for each index in the CF, a lookup process is performed into the CB to obtain the centroid representative of the original subunit. The obtained centroid is placed in the decompressed file. The compression is realized because the size of the input subunit ((8 or 24)*n2bits) is an order of magnitude larger than its encoding index log2[size of CB] bits. In order to achieve a better compression ratio, LZW is performed on CF (step38) before storing (or transmitting) it.

US-7840287-B2;Robust process model identification in model based control techniques ;2006;A robust method of creating process models for use in controller generation, such as in MPC controller generation, adds noise to the process data collected and used in the model generation process. In particular, a robust method of creating a parametric process model first collects process outputs based on known test input signals or sequences, adds random noise to the collected process data and then uses a standard or known technique to determine a process model from the collected process data. Unlike existing techniques for noise removal that focus on clean up of non-random noise prior to generating a process model, the addition of random, zero-mean noise to the process data enables, in many cases, the generation of an acceptable parametric process model in situations where no process model parameter convergence was otherwise obtained. Additionally, process models created using this technique generally have wider confidence intervals, therefore providing a model that works adequately in many process situations without needing to manually or graphically change the model.

US-8594828-B2;System and method for optimizing a paper manufacturing process ;2008;A technique is disclosed for optimizing a quality parameter in a process that is not directly measurable online using conventional measurement devices. The technique includes the use of a first inferential model to predict a value for the parameter based upon other process variables. A second inferential model predicts a residual component of the process parameter based off non-controllable residual variables of the process. The inferential model outputs are combined to produce a composite predicted value which may be further adjusted by an actual prediction error determined via comparison with an offline measurement. The adjusted predicted value is provided to a dynamic predictive model which may be adapted to implement control actions to drive or maintain the quality parameter at a target set point. The technique may further consider cost optimization factors and production reliability factors in order to produce a product meeting the target quality set point or range while considering production requirements and minimizing overall costs.
US-8478748-B2;Directly optimizing evaluation measures in learning to rank ;2008;The present invention provides methods for improving a ranking model. In one embodiment, a method includes the step of obtaining queries, documents, and document labels. The process then initializes active sets using the document labels, wherein two active sets are established for each query, a perfect active set and an imperfect active set. Then, the process optimizes an empirical loss function by the use of the first and second active set, whereby parameters of the ranking model are modified in accordance to the empirical loss function. The method then updates the active sets with additional ranking data, wherein the updates are configured to work in conjunction with the optimized loss function and modified ranking model. The recalculated active sets provide an indication for ranking the documents in a way that is more consistent with the document metadata.
