4868,GB-2546981-B,Noise compensation in speaker-adaptive systems ,2016,"Noise compensation in speaker-adaptive systems FIELD The present disclosure relates to a system and method for adapting an acoustic model which relates acoustic units to speech vectors. The system and method may be employed in a text-to-speech system and method. BACKGROUND Text to speech systems are systems where audio speech or audio speech files are output in response to reception of a text file. Voice cloning or customer voice building systems are systems which can synthesize speech with the voice of a given speaker with just a few samples of the voice of that speaker. Voice cloning systems are often combined with text to speech systems. Text to speech systems and voice cloning systems are used in a wide variety of applications such as electronic games, E-book readers, E-mail readers, satellite navigation, automated telephone systems, automated warning systems. There is a continuing need to make systems more robust to noise. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to aspects of the present invention there are provided a method for adapting an acoustic model relating acoustic units to speech vectors according to claim 1, and an apparatus according to claim 13. The method and apparatus can be employed respectively in a method of text to speech synthesis according to claim 9, and a text to speech apparatus according to claim 14. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Systems and methods in accordance with non-limiting examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying figures in which: Figure 1 shows a schematic of a text to speech system in accordance with an example of the invention; Figure 2 is a flow diagram of a text to speech process in accordance with an example of the invention; Figure 3 shows a Gaussian function; Figure 4 is a flow diagram of acoustic model adaptation using clean speech; Figure 5 is a flow diagram of acoustic model adaptation using noisy speech; Figure 6 is a schematic representation of the effect of noise levels on speaker parameters; Figure 7 is a schematic representation of mapping from noisy to clean speech parameters in accordance with an example of the invention; Figure 8 is a schematic representation of a system for mapping noisy speech parameters to clean speech parameters in accordance with an example of the invention; and Figure 9 is a flow diagram of neural network training in accordance with an example of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Figure 1 shows a text to speech system in accordance with an example of the invention of the present invention. The text to speech system 1 comprises a processor 3 which executes a program 5. The program 5 comprises an acoustic model. The acoustic model will be described in more detail below. Text to speech system 1 further comprises storage 7. The storage 7 stores data which is used by program 5 to convert text to speech. The text to speech system 1 further comprises an input module 11 and an output module 13. The input module 11 is connected to a text input 15. Text input 15 receives text. The text input 15 may be for example a keyboard. Alternatively, text input 15 may be a means for receiving text data from an external storage medium or a network. Connected to the output module 13 is an output for audio 17. The audio output 17 is used for outputting a speech signal converted from text which is input into text input 15. The audio output 17 may be for example a sound generation unit e.g. a speaker, or an output for an audio data file which may be sent to a storage medium, networked, etc. The text to speech system 1 also comprises an audio input 23 (such as a microphone) and an audio input module 21. In an example of the invention, the output of the audio input module 21 when the audio input module 21 receives a certain input audio signal (“input audio”) from the audio input 23, is used to adapt the speech output from the text to speech system. For example, the system may be configured to output speech with the same speaker voice as that of a sample of speech captured by the audio input 23. In this example of the invention, the text to speech system 1 receives an audio sample through audio input module 21 and text through text input 15. The program 5 executes on processor 3 and converts the text into speech data using data stored in the storage 7 and the input audio sample. The speech is output via the output module 13 to audio output 17. A simplified text to speech process will now be described with reference to Figure 2. In first step, S3101, text is input. The text may be input via a keyboard, touch screen, text predictor or the like. The text is then converted into a sequence of acoustic units in step S3103. These acoustic units may be phonemes or graphemes. The units may be context dependent e.g. triphones which take into account not only the phoneme which has been selected but the proceeding and following phonemes. The text is converted into the sequence of acoustic units using techniques which are well-known in the art and will not be explained further here. In step S3105, the probability distributions are looked up which relate acoustic units to speech parameters. In this example of the invention, the probability distributions will be Gaussian distributions which are defined by means and variances. However, it is possible to use other distributions such as the Poisson, Student-t, Laplacian or Gamma distributions some of which are defined by variables other than the mean and variance. It is impossible for each acoustic unit to have a definitive one-to-one correspondence to a speech vector or “observation” to use the terminology of the art. Many acoustic units are pronounced in a similar manner, are affected by surrounding acoustic units, their location in a word or sentence, or are pronounced differently by different speakers. Thus, each acoustic unit only has a probability of being related to a speech vector and text-to-speech systems calculate many probabilities and choose the most likely sequence of observations given a sequence of acoustic units. A Gaussian distribution is shown in figure 3. Figure 3 can be thought of as being the probability distribution of an acoustic unit relating to a speech vector. For example, the speech vector shown as X has a probability P of corresponding to the phoneme or other acoustic unit which has the distribution shown in figure 3. The shape and position of the Gaussian is defined by its mean and variance. These parameters are determined during the training of the system. These parameters are then used in the acoustic model in step S3107. In this description, the acoustic model is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). However, other models could also be used. The memory of the text of the speech system will store many probability density functions relating an acoustic unit i.e. phoneme, grapheme, word or part thereof to speech parameters. As the Gaussian distribution is generally used, these are generally referred to as Gaussians or components. In a Hidden Markov Model or other type of acoustic model, the probability of all potential speech vectors relating to a specific acoustic unit must be considered. Then the sequence of speech vectors which most likely corresponds to the sequence of acoustic units will be taken into account. This implies a global optimization over all the acoustic units of the sequence taking into account the way in which two units affect to each other. As a result, it is possible that the most likely speech vector for a specific acoustic unit is not the best speech vector when a sequence of acoustic units is considered. In some examples of the invention, there will be a plurality of different states which will be each be modelled using a Gaussian. For example, in an example of the invention, the text-to-speech system comprises multiple streams. Such streams may be selected from one or more of spectral parameters (Spectrum), Log of fundamental frequency (Log Fo), first differential of Log Fo (Delta Log Fo), second differential of Log Fo (Delta-Delta Log Fo), Band aperiodicity parameters (BAP), duration etc. The streams may also be further divided into classes such as silence (sil), short pause (pau) and speech (spe) etc. In an example of the invention, the data from each of the streams and classes will be modelled using a HMM. The HMM may comprise different numbers of states. For example, in an example of the invention, 5 state HMMs may be used to model the data from some of the above streams and classes. A Gaussian component is determined for each HMM state. Once a sequence of speech vectors has been determined, speech is output in step S3109. As noted above, in an example of the invention, the parameters employed in step S3105 may be adapted according to input audio which is input in to the system via audio input module 21 of Figure 1. This adaptation enables speech with the speaker voice (and/or the other speaker factor, as appropriate) of the input audio to be output from the text to speech system. In an example of the invention, the acoustic model is one which is able to capture a range factors of speech data such as speaker, expression or some other factor of speech data. In a further example of the invention, the output speech comprises the same value of a speaker factor as that of the input audio sample, i.e. the text to speech system 1 adapts the acoustic model such that the output speech matches that of the audio sample. For example, the output speech is output with the same speaker voice as the input speech. In an example of the invention, the acoustic model is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). However, other models could also be used. Hidden Markov Models and their training are described in Appendix 1. The modelling of speech factors such as speaker voice is explained in relation to three methods of training HMMs: Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR), Cluster Adaptive Training (CAT) and Constrained Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (CMLLR). Although any speech factor, or multiple speech factors can be used as a basis for adapting the output speech of a text to speech system, in the below description, it is assumed that the speech factor is that of speaker voice. Figure 4 shows a flow chart of the process of adaptation of such models in response to input audio where the audio was recorded under “clean” conditions, i.e. the input audio is not corrupted by noise. In step S201, the input audio (input speech) is received. In Step S203, the speaker transforms of the acoustic model are modified until a set of speaker transforms which most closely matches the input speech is determined. The nature of the speaker transforms and the method employed to obtain the set of speaker transforms will depend on the nature of the acoustic model employed. The training of three suitable acoustic models which capture speaker variation is described in Appendix 1. During training, an Auxiliary equation for each model (e.g. Equation (0) for MLLR) is minimised for each training speaker in order to obtain the corresponding speaker transform. In an example of the invention, during adaptation, the Auxiliary equation is minimized for the input adaptation data in order to obtain the speaker transform of the input speaker. Adaptation therefore comprises effectively retraining the acoustic model using the input data. If the exact context of the adaptation data is not found in the training data, decision trees are employed to find similar contexts within the training data instead. In Step S205, text to speech synthesis is performed employing the speaker transforms calculated in step S203 according to the process described above in relation to Figure 2. Thus, the speech of the input text is output with the same voice as that of the speech received in step S201. The above method is suitable for adapting acoustic models and obtaining speech which matches speech received under clean conditions, i.e. when the speech sample was obtained in a controlled sound environment, such as in a studio using high quality equipment. However, the input audio sample may be corrupted with additive or convolutional noise. If the method of Figure 4 were employed for a sample of speech obtained under noisy conditions, the speaker transform obtained during adaptation would be adapted to the corrupted speech and therefore itself be corrupted by noise. Consequently, the corresponding audio output would also be affected by the noise corrupting the original speech signal. Depending on the degree of noise corruption, the quality of match between the voice of the person to whom the speech sample belonged and the output audio may be poor. In an example of the invention, the system according to Figure 1 is configured to compensate for the noise in the input signal and therefore the output speech is substantially unaffected by the degree of noise corruption that the input audio sample is subjected to. The effect of noise on a speech signal can be modelled as follows. In an example of the invention, it is assumed that a speech signal s(r) is corrupted by an additive noise signal n(r) and a convolutional channel noise Λ(τ). The observed signal SO(T) will be S0(T) = (s(T)+n(j))*h(T) (0) Ignoring the effect of the window, the spectrum of this signal for frequency 0) on a frame around time t will be S0((o)=[S(w)+Ν(ω)]Η(ω) (0) Note that to simplify the notation, T has been omitted from the above equation. The power spectrum for the frame is I So(<o) l2=l S(<o)+Ν(ω) I2I Η(ω) I2 (0) and the logarithm of the amplitude becomes log(l So(ty)I)=0.51og(l S(tw)+N(tw)I2) +log(l H(ty) I). (0) IS(o)+N(o)l2 can be expanded as I S(<o)+N(<o) l2=l S(<o) I2 +1 Ν(ω) I2 +21 S(o) II Ν(ω) I cos(0s(<o)-0N(<o)), (0) wherein Θ represents the phase. The first term on the right hand side of Equation (0) can be shown to be log(l S(«) + N(«) I2) = 21og(l S(«) I) In an example of the invention, the speech signal is represented as a Cepstrum, which is a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of the log-spectrum. Equivalently, the DCT of the log-spectrum is a linear transformation of the log spectral vectors given by Equation (0) . In other words, «4 r) ™ ) ’ (0) where T is the DCT transformation matrix and where/is the frequency index. From Equations (0) and (0) it follows that (0) where and with and Therefore it follows that χν. 4 I 4· O.'Mfs < λ ι =· 4 ·<μ 4- 0.>5<u, .>·, ...... "" ' ' .....(0) where <4 -tl (0) c, (0) ’ (0) The Taylor series logarithmic expansion is given by for I x -11< 1 which is a reasonable assumption as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is positive. Therefore, each element of (^ becomes which depends in a non-linear way on both the speech signal and the additive noise. Obtaining a clean speaker transform from a speaker transform determined under noisy conditions is therefore non-trivial. When adapting an acoustic model to produce speech corresponding to a speaker to which an audio input corresponds, the goal is to transform a canonical model so that it can generate speech with the characteristics of the target speaker. When employing clean speech, the adaptation parameters model the differences between the speakers. However, when the adaptation data is noisy, instead of just modelling the difference between speakers, they must also adjust for the contribution of Cn/s and Ch terms as given in Equation (0). In addition, the precise effect that the noise has depends on the form of the canonical model employed. The effect of noise on the adaptation parameters for MLLR, CAT and CMLLR is discussed in detail in Appendix 2. The approach of the present example, however, may be applied to whatever type of acoustic model is employed in the system as will now be explained. Figure 5 shows a flow chart of a process according to an example of the invention in which an acoustic model is adapted to speech obtained in a noisy environment and compensation of the noise is then performed. In Step S301, speech is received. In Step S303, the speaker transforms of the acoustic model are modified until a set of speaker transforms which most closely matches the input speech is determined. This process is entirely equivalent to that of S203 in Figure 4. In Step S305 features relating to the characteristics of the noise are determined from the input speech. This gives a noise characterization defined by one or more noise parameters. A variety of noise features may be used to calculate the characteristics of noise in the speech sample. Examples include the average spectrum and mel-cepstrum of non-speech segments of the sample or the ratio of noise to speech. In another example of the invention, a segment (e.g. of several seconds) of audio without speech are input and the analyser calculates the noise parameters from the sample without speech. In Step S307, the speaker transform calculated in step S303 and the noise parameters calculated in Step S305 are employed to determine a “clean” speaker transform, that is, the speaker transform that would have been obtained if the received speech had been obtained under clean conditions. In an example of the invention, this step comprises mapping a “noisy” speaker transform to a “clean” speaker transform. This process will now be described in detail. Figure 6 is a schematic diagram of the speaker transform space according to an example of the invention. The effect of noise on speaker transform is indicated by contour lines. The position of the transforms corresponding to three speakers, Spkl, Spk2 and Spk 3, are indicated at four different noise levels, NoiseLevelo, NoiscLcvcl i. NoiscLcvcL and NoiscLevel i. The speaker transforms at NoiseLevelo are those obtained under clean conditions. The level of noise increases on going from NoiseLevelo to NoiscLcvcL Figure 6 shows that as the noise level increases, the difference between the transforms of different speaker decreases. At high enough levels of noise (i.e. the centre of the contour lines), there will be no difference in the speaker transform obtained from samples of speech from different speakers. In an example of the invention, obtaining a clean speaker transform comprises mapping a speaker transform obtained at one noise level to the speaker transform which would have been obtained at another noise level within the speaker space. This mapping is shown schematically in Figure 7. A speaker transform is obtained from a sample of speech from speaker 3 at NoiscLcvcL. This is indicated by the solid triangle 1011 in Figure 7. Using knowledge of the level of noise within the sample, the speaker transform is mapped from NoiscLcvcL to NoiseLevelo, i.e. to position 1103. In an example of the invention, the mapping from noisy to clean space is performed using an adaptive model trained by a machine learning method, e.g. an artificial deep neural network (DNN). In an example of the invention, a deep neural network is employed to determine a function f such that where xs?k is the transform obtained under noise, yn is a vector that characterises the noise and x^is the transform which would be obtained without noise. Figure 8 shows a schematic of a system for performing the mapping. An analyser 2001 determines the speaker transforms from the noisy data. The analyser also determines the noise features of the noisy data. The analyser calculates the value of the speaker transform in the presence of noise, i.e. the position indicated by 1101 in Figure 7 (the “speaker features”). The analyser also calculates the noise parameters characterizing noise in the speech. The skilled person will appreciate that the calculation of noise may be performed in a number of ways. Both the speaker transforms and the noise features are input into the neural network 2003. The neural network maps the “noisy” speaker transforms to the clean speaker transforms using Equation (0). The clean speaker transform x^fcis then output to the acoustic model. Finally, in step S309 of the method of Figure 5, the clean speaker transform obtained in step S307 is employed to output audio using the process described above in relation to Figure 2. Figure 9 shows a generalised process for training a neural network for use in an example of the invention. In this process, training data is employed to train the mapping. The training data can be created by adding different types of noise to existing clean data for a number of different speakers. In Step S501, the acoustic model or models are trained with samples of clean speech for each of plurality of speakers (“training speakers”). The training of an acoustic model according to an example of the invention is described in Appendix 1. Subsequently, the set of steps S502 to S504 is performed separately for each of the training speakers, thereby producing respective results for each training speaker. In Step S502, for a given one of the training speakers, speaker parameters A(t) for the clean speech training data for that training speaker are obtained. In Step S503, noisy speech data Ί] is created. In an example of the invention, this is done by adding different types of noise to some existing clean data for the training speaker. In Step S504, adaptation parameters denoted as are obtained for the created noisy data Ί] using the process of adaptation described above. In Step S505, the neural network is initialised. The skilled person will appreciate that a number of standard methods may be employed to initialise the neural network. In an example of the invention, random initialisation is employed. Steps S506 and S507 are performed using the results obtained in steps S502 and S504 for all the training speakers. That is, the speaker parameters A(t) and adaptation parameters obtained in steps S502 and S504 for the respective multiple training speakers, are combined into a single dataset which is used in steps S506 and S507. In Step S506, the neural network error is calculated. The noisy adaptation parameters λη1) together with a vector of parameters to characterize the noise φη (noise features), are used as input for the DNN. The neural network then outputs “clean” speaker -(0 transforms Κη . —(0 The output of the DNN will be a vector of adaptation parameters , which should be as close as possible to the parameters λ<υ that were obtained when using the clean speech. The neural network error is calculated by comparing these two sets of parameters. In an example of the invention, the neural network error function can be calculated as the difference between the predicted speaker transforms and the target coefficients, i.e. the root mean square error (RMSE): where 0) are the parameters of the deep neural network (DNN). The derivative of £(uj)^WS/ (the “back propagation error”) is given by In another example of the invention, the error function is given by the log-likelihood over the clean training data, i.e. where the Auxiliary function is computed over the clean data with the state occupancies obtained by using the clean transform λ<υ . The derivative of is given by Equations (0) and (0) in the Appendix for MLLR and CLLR respectively. In this example of the invention, the back propagation error can be expressed as where k and G are the sufficient statistics necessary to estimate the transformation parameters. In step S507, the neural network is modified using stochastic gradient descent to reduce the error calculated in Step S506 above. In an example of the invention, this comprises varying the parameters 0) until the back propagation error is zero. In other words, the DNN is trained, upon receiving noisy speech and parameters characterizing the noise, to produce an estimate of the parameters which would have been obtained by performing step S502 on the noisy speech if the noisy speech had not been corrupted by noise. The process then moves back to step S506 and repeats until the NN error reaches convergence. Thus, the parameters of the neural network are updated to learn the mapping from noisy speaker space to clean speaker space. In an example of the invention, a noise feature vector that provides a good estimation of λη/s and λ/, is determined by the analyser 2001 for input into the DNN 2003. Methods and systems according to the above examples of the invention can be applied to any adaptable acoustic model. Because the neural network is capable of pattern recognition, the relationship between the speaker transforms of a particular model and noise can be learnt by the network, regardless of the model employed. As shown in Appendix 2, when an MLLR (or CAT) model is employed, the function f of Equation (0) is given by Equation (0). Methods and systems according to the examples of the invention described above enable speech to be synthesised in a target voice without the need for high quality, low noise samples of speech in that voice. Instead, samples of the target voice may be provided without the use of a studio or high quality equipment. Speaker similarity is preserved without the use of signal processing to compensate or clean the noise. While certain arrangements have been described, these arrangements have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions. Indeed, the novel methods and systems described herein may be embodied in a variety of other forms; furthermore, various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the methods and systems described herein may be made. Appendix 1 In speech processing systems which are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), the HMM is often expressed as: M = (A , B , Π ) (0) where A = \a } and is the state transition probability distribution, B = (/7.(0)}^ is the state output probability distribution and Π = is the initial state probability distribution and where N is the number of states in the HMM. In the examples of the invention described below, the state transition probability distribution A and the initial state probability distribution are determined in accordance with procedures well known in the art. Therefore, this section will be concerned with the state output probability distribution. The aim when training a conventional text-to-speech system is to estimate the model parameter set which maximises likelihood for a given observation sequence. The same system as that shown in Figure 1 may be used for training an acoustic model for use in a text-to-speech system. However, when training an acoustic model, it is necessary to have an audio input which matches the text being input via text input 15. Training the model therefore comprises maximising the model parameter set which maximises the likelihood of the audio input. Generally in text to speech systems the state output vector or speech vector o(i) from an mth Gaussian component in a model set M is p(o, I = Σ„) (0) where μη and Zm are the mean and covariance of the m11' Gaussian component. As it is not possible to obtain the above model set based on so called Maximum Likelihood (ML) criteria purely analytically, the problem is conventionally addressed by using an iterative approach known as the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm which is often referred to as the Baum-Welch algorithm. Here, an auxiliary function (the “Q” function) is derived: (0) where ym (t) is the posterior probability of component m generating the observation o(t) given the current model parameters M’ and M is the new parameter set. After each iteration, the parameter set M’ is replaced by the new parameter set M which maximises Q(M, M’). p(o(i), m | M) is a generative model such as a GMM, HMM etc. The model may incorporate factors of speech data such as speaker, expression, or noise environment, or some other factor of speech data. The model then has a state output vector of: (0) where m e {1,.......,ΜΝ} , T, and t are indices for component, time and target speaker, or expression or some other factor of speech data respectively and where MN, T and S are the total number of components, frames and speakers (or expression, or noise environment, or some other factor of speech data) respectively. In the discussion below, it is assumed the speech factor is speaker. The exact form of and will depend on any speaker dependent transforms that are applied. Three approaches to such speaker dependent transformations are discussed below. However, others are also possible. MLLR When employing a Maximum-likelihood linear regression (MLLR) transform, the goal is to find an affine transformation of the canonical parameters that maximises the probability with respect to the adaptation data cw of a target speaker t. This transformation is independent for the mean and the covariances of the model. Considering only the effect on the mean, the MLLR mean transformation can be written as where {Α^,Ζ?^} represents the affine transformation which is applied to the mean vector of the Gaussian component 1TI for regression class q(m). This can be expressed in a more compact form as Each dimension d in μ^’ can be also represented as where Aj^[d] is the d‘h line of the A^ matrix which can be also expressed as Where λ11’ is a supervector with all the adaptation parameters and K(|(m (l) is a selection matrix for the Gaussian 1TI and dimension d . Now, Equation (O)Error! Reference source not found, can be rewritten as μ'ΐ’=Μ|(,ηιλπ’ (0) where Mtfm) is a matrix which lines are defined as Mq(m)[d] = I'm ^q(m,d) (θ) The adaptation coefficients are obtained by maximising the auxiliary function where Σν(πι) is the covariance of component 1TI. and 0 is an observation vector which is usually built by joining the static and dynamic spectral coefficients, e.g., Ο=[<ΧΑΓ (0) The Δ and Δ2 are usually linear operators that can be summarized as o = Wc with W a fixed matrix. The derivative of (0) with respect to λ<υ is where which equating Equation (0) to zero yields the solution λ(ι) =(Ο(ι))-^(ι) CAT Cluster adaptive training (CAT) is a special case of MLLR in which different speakers are accommodated by applying weights to model parameters which have been arranged into clusters. In this model the mean value is defined as where P is the total number of clusters. Consequently, all the Equations described above in relation to MLLR apply equally to CAT, with M[(m) substituted by CMLLR When using a constrained maximum-likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) transform, the transformation is applied in the feature space. The goal of the adaptation is to find an affine transformation of the observed feature vector that maximizes the probability with respect to a model trained on a canonical space. The state output vector is given by: Similarly to MLLR, the CMLLR transform can be expressed as with As in Equation (0), each dimension of οζτ)^) can be expressed as Therefore, as with MLLR this can be written as where λ (t) is the supervector with all the CMLLR coefficients and Oq(m) a matrix with lines given by with Kq(in d) the selection matrix for CMLLR. The derivative of 2(λ(υ;λ<}) w.r.t. λ<υ can again be expressed as where now which yields the solution Appendix 2 The effect of noise on transforms according to the acoustic models discussed in Appendix 1 will now be described. In an example of the invention, the acoustic model employed is a Maximum-likelihood Linear regression model (MLLR). For MLLR, it follows from Equations (0) and (0) (see Appendix 1) that 0=^+0.50^+¾ (0) Substituting in (0) gives and consequently where In other words, the effect of additive and convolutional noise in an MLLR transform is to add a bias to that transform, which depends in a non-linear way on the noise-to-signal ratio. From the above, it can be seen that in the case of MLLR, the function f in Equation (0) is therefore given (from Equation (0)) as with In another example of the invention, a CAT acoustic model is employed. The main difference between CAT and general MLLR is that due to its simplicity, CAT models trained on clean speech are strictly constrained to a space of clean speech. As a result, if θη/s or °h are orthogonal to clean speech, their projection into that space will be zero, In yet another example of the invention, a CMLLR acoustic model is employed. In CMLLR, from Equations (0) and (0) The noisy terms in the CMLLR case are now both in the numerator and the denominator of Equation (0). The relationship between the noisy and the clean transform is therefore much more complex than for MLLR."

4887,ES-2635285-B2,Method and system for non-invasive characterization of human and animal tissues in vivo ,2016,"DESCRIPTION Method and system for non-invasive characterization of human and animal tissues in vivo. Sector of the technique The present invention fits into the field of methods and apparatus for determining the composition of animal or human tissues in vivo non-invasively. More specifically, the invention relates to the intelligent determination of the breast tissue composition by combining spectroscopic techniques and neural networks. State of the art Raman spectroscopy is a photonic technique capable of providing molecular information of materials, whether organic or inorganic, allowing its identification. The analysis by means of Raman spectroscopy is based on the treatment of light scattered by a material when striking a monochromatic beam of light. A small portion of the incident light is dispersed inelastically, experiencing slight changes in frequency that are characteristic of the chemical structure of the material analyzed, and independent of the frequency of the incident light. It is an analysis technique that is performed directly on the material to be analyzed without needing any special type of preparation and that does not involve any alteration of the surface on which the analysis is performed; that is, it is a non-destructive technique. For this reason it has been applied in the analysis of a great variety of biological tissues such as fluids, cells and tissues. The biochemical changes in cells and tissues, which can be caused or be the cause of diseases, can lead to significant changes in the Raman spectrum, so this technique presents a high potential for use in the diagnosis and prognosis of different diseases. as a tool to evaluate new therapies (K. Kong et al,Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 89(2015)121-134). Raman spectroscopy has been applied in breast cancer detection identifying microcalcifications in malignant and benign lesions. Microcalcifications are markers of cellular degradation and necrosis and are chemically composed of calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite mineral deposits (Radi MJ., Axch Pathol Lab Med 113 (1989) 1367-9). In general, calcium oxalate is associated with benign lesions while hydroxyapatite deposits are associated with proliferative lesions such as carcinoma. Based on the analysis of these calcium compounds, Haka et al. (Cancer Research 62 (2002) 5375-5380) concluded that the Raman technique can be applied, firstly, in-vitro on small samples of biopsied tissue being desirable its in-vivo application combined with the mammography to select patients with microcalcifications that They need to have a biopsy. On the other hand, changes in tissue composition associated with malignancy are reflected not only in the composition of microcalcifications but also in an increase in nucleoproteins and nucleic acids, so a complete biochemical analysis could lead to more reliable results. The in-vitro application on biopsied tissue, in addition to being an invasive technique, has the disadvantage that a small sample of tissue is analyzed, so it can happen that the sample is not representative of the entire breast volume. The in-vivo application has the disadvantage that it is only able to provide very close tissue information  to the surface (few tens of micrometers deep). To increase the depth of the analyzed tissue that allows a biochemical exploration of a large area (as in the case of the breast), it is necessary a time of analysis so high that the technique is not viable in practice. To overcome this drawback in US20090238333 a method is described where tissue compositions are analyzed in different areas of the outer surface thereof and, by means of a numerical model, the composition of the rest of tissue is predicted. This method allows to know the real composition of the tissue in superficial layers but the composition in deeper layers is only an estimate that results from the application of a mathematical method so it does not allow, therefore, to know with certainty the real composition of the tissue in deep layers. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop an in-vivo, non-invasive study method capable of reliably analyzing the chemical composition of breast tissue in both superficial and deep layers and at a time that makes it possible to use it in the diagnosis and monitoring of the breast cancer Likewise, it would be necessary to include intelligent algorithms to be able to consider the changes in the analytes of the chemical composition and be applied to more efficient diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer. Description of the invention In the present invention, a method of in vivo analysis of animal or human tissue is described to determine the chemical composition and characteristics thereof that combines a fast scanning of diffuse optics and a precise Raman scan allowing the biochemical exploration of a large area in short. space of time. The identification of the type of tissue according to its instantaneous chemical composition is possible thanks to a spectral library obtained by a laser pulse in only one of the representative samples and its subsequent treatment using neural networks. The results obtained show an efficacy of more than 99.99% in the tissues analyzed. The method combines: - Infrared low-precision diffuse optical scanning (DOT), whose error is tilted to the excess of false positives, in order to determine areas suspected of containing certain chemical compounds. Storage of scans of suspicious areas of information in neural networks. - Analysis of the data obtained in the DOT infrared scan through the use of designed neural networks and the previously created neuronal database for the classification of the suspect tissue. - Accurate scanning Raman / SORS (Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy) bounded to areas of suspicious tissue. Storage of accurate and bounded scans of suspicious areas in neural networks. - Analysis of the data obtained in precise Raman / SORS scanning through the use of trained neural networks with known Raman signatures database of previous Raman scans and stored information. - Determination of the chemical composition and / or characteristics of the tissue by means of software that combines the results of the neural networks of diffuse optics and  Raman analysis with specific criteria such as, for example, the morphology of the calcifications present in the tissue. The first scan is performed to find areas where, subsequently, apply Raman spectroscopy and consists of a diffuse optical tomography (DOT) with near infrared beam (NIR, Near InfraRed). The information obtained with a NIR beam of light is treated raw to feed a real-time neural network that determines if a Raman exploration is necessary in a specific area. Likewise, this information of conflicting zones is stored with its chemical composition collected in the neural networks to improve the classifications over time. The transport of light in tissue at these wavelengths in a certain direction of dispersion becomes almost isotropic, so it can be predicted correctly with a diffuse optics model. For the analysis of the data obtained by fuzzy optics, a finite element model and image reconstruction algorithms are used. To the information obtained in the first scan by DOT, the analysis of the Raman bands of a second scan by Raman spectrometry is added. Raman scanning is performed using the spatial compensation technique Raman SORS that is effective at depths of 500 mm in biological tissue. The Raman signal is coupled through an optical image projection to an optical fiber beam and delivered to a high performance infrared (Charge Coupled Device) CCD sensor. In this way, detailed information on the chemical composition of the tissues is obtained. Given the great variability that appears in cancers and chemical compositions, the creation of databases in neural networks give the possibility of resolving spectra with much more reliability. Asl, for example, healthy mammary tissue in humans shows Raman bands at 1078, 1300, 1445 and 1651 cm-1 and malignant tissue only shows bands at 1445 and 1651 cm-1. Benign tumors have characteristic bands at 1240, 1445 and 1659 cm-1. In addition, the intensities of bands 1445 and 1651 cm-1 are correlated with the classification of the disease. The obtained Raman data is analyzed using a neural network (NN) with forward connections, specifically following a propagation perceptron model (retropropagation, perceptron model). The NN consists of three layers called input, output and hidden, formed by neurons (only operative element). The input layer is used only for the entry of the data matrix in the NN. In the other layers, non-linear calculations are made. In the hidden layer each neuron receives signals from other input nodes, adding these through the activation function. Then the result is transformed by the transfer function to subsequently be sent to the output neurons to determine if the recognition is positive or negative. All these neurons and nodes are linked forward and each union is weighted by means of variables called weights. These weights are responsible for adapting to the system to model and ""remember"" the information presented to the model. The basic backpropagation algorithms adjust the weights in a steep slope of descending direction (negative values of the gradient); that is, the direction in which the performance function decreases more rapidly. The basic measurements are the number of positives and negatives (true and false, PV, NV, FP, FN) from which the sensitivity and specificity of the detection processes is determined. A true positive (PV) corresponds to the correct detection of a substance, compound or characteristic in a sample, when it actually exists. A true negative (NV) corresponds to the negative detection of a substance, compound or characteristic of a sample when it does not exist. The detections are considered false (PF, NF) when the detection does not correspond to the reality of the sample. The obtained Raman data is stored in a neural network (NN) for later analysis and to improve the resolutions of the spectra. This storage is carried out by  medium of a neural network and its weights. These weights are adapted to each of the data of conflicting spectra and their chemical composition presented to the network. In this way, the system under study and its composition are recorded in the form of a numerical matrix that adapts to the new spectra / composition that are presented over time. The interaction of light with matter in a linear regime allows the absorption and emission of light that adjusts to the energy levels already defined by the electrons. The Raman effect corresponds, in the theory of perturbations of quantum mechanics, to the absorption and consequent emission of a photon by changing the intermediate state of an electron, passing through a virtual state. There are the following possibilities: 1. There is no energy exchange between the incident photons and the molecules (there is, therefore, no Raman effect) 2. There is energy exchange between the incident photons and the molecules. The energy differences are equal to the differences of the vibrational or rotational states of the molecule. These are differences in energy measured by subtracting the energy of a mono-energetic laser from light scattered photons. In crystals, only certain photons are admitted by the crystal structure so that the Raman scattering effect can appear only at certain frequencies. • Molecules absorb energy (Stokes scattering). The resulting photon is of lower frequency and generates a Stokes line on the red side of the incident spectrum. • The molecule loses energy (anti-Stokes scattering). The incident photons are displaced at higher frequencies (blue) of the spectrum and, therefore, generate a line called anti-Stokes. The intensities of the Raman bands only depend on the number of molecules that occupy the different vibrational states; The variation of the frequencies determines the chemical structure of the material analyzed. Mode of realization of the invention The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting of the scope thereof. Example 1 This example refers to the infrared preliminary scan and creation of the intelligent database of conflicting data. In the first scan to find areas to apply Raman spectroscopy, a diffuse optics tomography with infrared beam is performed. The information derived from the exploration with a NIR light beam of wavelengths between 650 and 900 nm is treated raw to feed the real-time neural network so that the intrinsic optical properties of the tissue can be extracted in each of the different wavelengths applied, thus obtaining! the amount of hemoglobin or the proportion of water and the saturation of oxygen in each tissue area. The results obtained can also be interpreted graphically to distinguish between tissue areas that are suspicious and not suspicious of presenting a lesion and on which to perform a subsequent analysis using Raman SORS. This information of optical properties and concentration of hemoglobin or water from the conflictive zones are included in a neural network to improve the subsequent analyzes. Example 2 This example refers to the analysis of breast tissue using the Raman SORS technique. Creation of the database in the form of a neural network. A Raman spectrum is obtained from a sample of breast tissue following the SORS method described in US7652763 and using a laser diode for Raman spectroscopy with temperature stabilization, attenuating at 115 mW and operating at 827 nm(Micro Laser Systems, Lepton IV Series Diffraction Limited Diode Lasers L4-830S).The power incident on the sample is 50 mW with a beam diameter of 0.5 -1 mm. The beam is spectrally filtered to remove spontaneous emission components using two 830 nm band pass filters from Semrock. The beam impinges on the sample at an angle of 45 °. The spatial displacement is 3 mm. For the acquisition of the Raman light, a lens with a diameter of 50 mm and a focal length of 60 mm is used. The scattered light is collimated and passed through a 50 mm diameter holographic filter (Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc. Holographic Notch Filter 830 nm) to remove elastic dispersion components. The Raman light is propagated through SORS annular fiber systems of ~ 2 m in length to the input of theHoloSpec™f / 1.8 (.Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc.) spectrograph.The Raman spectrum is obtained through a CCD camera Andor Technology DU420A-BR-DD, 1024 x 256 pixels. The ring fiber system consists of a beam of 50 active fibers responsible for collecting light (scattered by the sample) placed in a circle at a distance of 3 mm around the emission point that directs the laser light towards the sample. By using this configuration the intensity of the signal can be greatly increased. With exposures of 0.2 to 10 seconds, the spectrum of a volume of 50x50x14 mm is acquired, resulting in the generation of 20 GB of data with which the Raman analysis stage of the neural network is fed. These generated data were transformed into a numeric matrix of weights that store the information gathered in the experiment, reducing its size to 500MB. Example 3 In this example, the sorting mode of the analyzed tissue is shown. Using Raman spectrometry, detailed information on the chemical composition of the tissue is obtained. Looking for differences in the Raman readings in mammary tissues it is observed that the healthy tissue shows Raman bands in 1078, 1300, 1445 and 1651 cm-1. Benign tumors have characteristic bands at 1240.1445 and 1659 cm-1. In addition, the intensities relative to the bands 1445 and 1651 cm-1 are correlated with the tissue classification in malignant, benign or normal (Manoharan, R. et al .. Photochemistry and Photobiology, 67 (1), (1998), 15 22 ). Normal breast tissue is easy to distinguish because it has strong Raman signals from abundance of lipids. However, the differentiation between tissue with malignant or benign lesions is difficult because in both cases there is a high protein content due to stromal changes (Mahoran, R. et al.,Photochemistry and Photobiology,67 (1), (1998)). , 15-22). To obtain the differentiation, the obtained Raman data are analyzed using a feed-forward neural network, specifically with a multilayer perceptron propagation model. Using retropropagation algorithms for the optimization of weights, as mentioned above. The main components are analyzed to examine the spectral differences between malignant and benign tumors. Instead of constructing an algorithm based on a series of spectral characteristics, the principal component analysis allows the full range of data to be used to develop a decision algorithm by logistic regression. Using the adjustment coefficients of these main components, we estimate the probability that each sample belongs to a category (normal, benign or malignant). These results show that the Raman spectra contain the necessary information to differentiate normal, benign and malignant mammary tissue."

Various configurable aspects of the system include selection and morphing of a text-to-speech voice; configuration of acoustic model, language model, vocabulary, and grammar; configuration of a graphic animation; configuration of virtual assistant personality parameters; invocation of a particular user profile; invocation of an authentication function; and configuration of an open sound. Configuration depends on a target market segment. Configuration also depends on the state of the dialog system, such as whether a previous utterance was an information query."
4998,US-10229678-B2,Device-described natural language control ,2016,"A remote device has an associated natural language description that includes a record of commands supported by the remote device. This record of commands includes command names, the command functions to which those names correspond, and natural language strings that are the natural language words or phrases that correspond to the command. A computing device includes a device control module that obtains the natural language description for the remote device and provides the natural language strings to a natural language assistant on the computing device. The natural language assistant monitors the natural language inputs to the computing device, and notifies the device control module when a natural language input matches one of the natural language strings. The device control module uses the natural language description to determine the command name that corresponds to the matching natural language string, and communicates the command name to the remote device."
4999,US-11487709-B2,Document replication based on distributional semantics ,2016,"Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward systems, methods, and computer storage media for using a neural network language model to identify semantic relationships between file storage specifications for replication requests. By treating file storage specifications (or at least a portion thereof) as “words” in the language model, replication vectors can be determined based on the file storage specifications. Instead of determining the relationship of the file storage specifications based on ordering within a document, the relationship can be based on proximity of the replication requests in a replication session. When a replication request is received from a user, the replication vectors can be used to determine a semantic similarity between the received replication request and one or more additional replication requests."
5000,US-11125593-B2,Anomaly detection and neural network algorithms for PST hydrocyclone condition monitoring ,2016,"A system includes a learning network having a signal processor configured to: receive learned signaling containing information about representative samples of conditions related to operating states of a hydrocyclone and characterized as learned samples of each condition when the learning network is trained, and raw signaling containing information about raw samples containing information about the current operation of the hydrocyclone; and determine corresponding signaling containing information about an operating state of the current operation of the hydrocyclone based upon a comparison of the learned signaling and the raw signaling."
