2574,AT-505326-B1,DEVICE FOR THE MODEL-BASED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMBUSTION ENGINE ,2008,"Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 The invention relates to a device for model-based development of an internal combustion engine, subsystems being assigned to submodels, and wherein the device has at least one virtual engine test stand for simulating the internal combustion engine and an engine test stand together with a power brake. For parameterization of engine control units, a significant number of measurements on engine test benches are necessary in an early project phase, the stationary Bedatung. As more and more actuators are installed in modern internal combustion engines, the number of Verstellparameter increases. Associated with this, the combination possibilities and therefore also the calibration effort increase exponentially. The number of measurements required increases to the same extent, necessitating new application tools and modified methods. In addition, the development time must be shortened in order to remain competitive in the market. In order to fully exploit cost-effective mass production, few engine families are used in different vehicle types, which additionally increases the application effort. This engine test stands fully automated, unmanned and safe operation, a great deal of technical effort is necessary. A modern engine test bench consists of numerous systems and programs that communicate with each other via different interfaces. Critical measured variables are constantly monitored by the test bed system in order to minimize the risk of engine damage. To effectively protect the engine, intelligent routines are required, as critical operating points sometimes have to be calculated or estimated in advance. In practice, the parameterization of automatic runs turns out to be very difficult because it depends essentially on the experience and the skill of the application engineer. The task is made even more difficult by careless mistakes and the fact that in the rarest cases all eventualities can be considered in advance. Thus, it is necessary that the automatic test run is observed for a long time after the start of the engineer and usually has to be aborted and modified several times. Since these activities are naturally performed on the test bench, such a procedure is associated with considerable costs and thus undesirable. In addition, the acceptance decreases, because during the time of the test-run creation, other tests that are important for the project could be run. The long parameterization also reduces the time saved by automatic runs in the normal case. WO 2006/007621 A2 describes a method for investigating the behavior of complex systems by forming a model comprising different measured variables as a function of input variables. In this case, after selecting different measuring points and after carrying out measurements for determining measured variables on a real system, a model is created which depicts the dependence of the measured variables on the input variables. The model is calibrated on the basis of the measured values of the real system obtained at the measuring points and subdivided into at least two partial models, with a first partial model representing a first subset of the measured variables. For the first sub-model, at least one first main influence parameter is identified and an optimal value of the first main influence parameter is determined in each measurement point. Then, the first main influence parameter is interpolated for all meaningful constellations of input variables for calibration of the first submodel. Furthermore, a further submodel for mapping a further subset of the measured variables as a function of the input variables and the previously determined first subset of the measured variables and at least one further main influencing parameter for the further submodel is identified. Finally, an optimum value of the second main influence parameter is determined at each measurement point. This makes it possible, even with a small number of real data determined to create meaningful models that have high prognosis quality. Furthermore, an automatic calibration method for control software is known from FR 2 788 143 A1, wherein a controlled internal combustion engine together with environment simulates in one execution phase and in an analysis phase following this execution phase the results be analyzed by the computer. The AT 009.467 U2 discloses a device for simulating a development system for a test bed for a test specimen with a real automation device for operating the test bench and with a simulation device, wherein the test bed and the test object is simulated in the simulation device by means of a simulation data generating test model and the automation device and the simulation device are connected via the real interfaces of the development plant and the automation device processes generated simulation data. A number of real development tools are provided in the development facility, and device models generating development data are provided in the simulation facility, wherein the device models at least partially process simulation data from the test model. The development tools are connected via real interfaces with the automation device and / or the simulation device, wherein the development tools process development data. To simulate certain test bench hardware, such as a loading machine, a hardware simulator is provided in the simulation device. Furthermore, from AT 009 566 U2 a device for simulating a test bed environment is known, wherein the test bed environment hardware is implemented as a virtual PC on a simulation PC, the system time of the virtual PC by a factor which is a multiple of the time base of the simulation PC corresponds, is stretched and whereby the real test software is operated on the virtual PC under the slowed system time. The object of the invention is to reduce the necessary in advance for test runs of internal combustion engines on engine test rigs application costs. According to the invention this is achieved in that the real-time capable virtual engine dynamometer for simulating the real engine dynamometer including power brake has at least one dynamic model with a mass inertia model for the engine and power brake. As a result, a test rig structure with a performance brake can be simulated. The internal combustion engine together with an engine test bench is simulated by corresponding models, wherein the operation of the internal combustion engine is simulated on a virtual engine test bench by at least one real-time engine model, an engine control unit model and a dynamic model. Preferably, it is provided that the dynamics model is integrated into the engine model. The engine model can have at least one intake manifold model and a Verbrennungsmo-dell, in particular, the engine model is adaptable to a real engine behavior via operating parameters. The engine model can thus be adapted to a new engine via a few design parameters, such as displacement, number of cylinders or the like. In order to simulate an engine start close to reality, the dynamic model can have a starter model. The engine model has at least one intake manifold model and a combustion model, preferably also an emission model on. In order to use conventional test bench software, it is advantageous if at least one measuring device simulation model is provided. Analogous to a real engine dynamometer, the engine operating conditions of the virtual engine can be changed automatically, and it is particularly advantageous if the device has an interface to an engine dynamometer system. The invention will be explained in more detail below by means of an exemplary embodiment with reference to FIG. 2, 4, of the Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15. 1 shows the structure of a real engine test stand, Fig. 2 shows the structure of a virtual engine test bench and Fig. 3 shows a motor model of the virtual engine test stand. 1, a real internal combustion engine 2 is subjected to a fully automatic test bench routine, the internal combustion engine being operated via a pedal simulator 4 controlled by an engine test bench system 3 in a predefined driving program, and the pedal simulator 4 acts directly on the engine control unit ECU. To load the engine, the internal combustion engine 2 is coupled to a power brake 5. To the internal combustion engine 2, an exhaust gas measuring device 6 and for consumption measurement, a consumption measuring device 7 and optionally further measuring systems 8 are further connected to the exhaust gas measurement. In the illustrated in Fig. 1 embodiment of a real engine dynamometer 1 includes as a motor test bench system 3 a known under the product name EMCON AVL LIST GMBH control program for the internal combustion engine. Furthermore, the illustrated engine test bench system 3 includes a test bench system software known under the product name PUMA OPEN of AVL LIST GMBH, which serves for test bench control, for the management of the measuring devices and for the storage of the measurement results. Measuring channels of simple temperature and pressure sensors are read in via the analogue-to-digital converter FFEM (Fast Front End Modules) to the EMCON control system. Both the PUMA OPEN test bed system and the EMCON control system require a real-time system to ensure that certain calculations are processed within a predefined maximum time. Another task of the software PUMA OPEN is the limit value monitoring. Here, individual measuring channels can be provided with warning and alarm limits, at the triggering of which the test bed system carries out defined procedures. When a limit is exceeded, for example, an engine stop or a cold run can be activated. In addition, it is possible that a reaction is triggered only after prolonged exceeding after a predefined time. Typically, the engine speed, the exhaust gas temperature and the blow-by of the engine are monitored, limit values can also be parameterized via maps. So different limits are possible for different operating points. In order to perform automated surveys on the real engine test bench 1, a parameterization system 9 is necessary in which the desired test runs can be parameterized. During the test run, it must be able to transmit the necessary commands to the test bench system. Such a parameterization system 9 is, for example, the software CAMEO AVL LIST GMBH, but also represents a modular optimization tool for the computer-aided tuning and optimization of engine controls. As the first function of the CAMEO workflow, any characteristic maps, characteristic curves and fixed values from the engine control unit ECU can be loaded and displayed. Subsequently, the user can create automated test runs to optimize this data. In addition to grid surveys, statistical DoE methods (Design of Experiment) are also available. DoE methods can greatly reduce the number of necessary variations with the same informative value. Operating points, the results of which can be well modeled due to neighboring points, are omitted during the measurement. In addition, CAMEO has a connection to various application systems and thus to the engine control unit ECU. During the measurement from one operating point, any desired engine variable, such as camshaft position, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates, ignition times, etc., can thereby be changed. This makes it possible to measure multi-dimensional test rooms. The connection to an application system 10 is normally made via a standardized ASAP 3 protocol. This can only be used for communication between two systems. In order to be able to measure ECU channels in the PUMA OPEN test bench system and store them in the database, a so-called ASAP 3 server is provided, which acts as a switch between the various systems PUMA OPEN and CAMEO acts. The interface used is in each case a TCP / IP connection (TCP / IP = Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol), whereby the protocols are different: while between the application system 10 and the server an ASAP 3 protocol (ASAP = working group for the standardization of Application systems), a separate protocol named ACI (Automatic Calibration Interface) was developed for the connection of CAMEO, which is based on DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) and thus internal components of the well-known MICROSOFT operating system WINDOWS. In a further step of the CAMEO workflow, the tests created can be automated on the engine test bench 1. The operating point setting and the measurement data acquisition are controlled by the automation system. In some cases, a limit value monitoring in CAMEO makes sense, which can be parameterized by the applicator during test run production. For special application tasks so-called iProcedures (Intelligent Test Run Procedures) are available in which very specific test procedures and calculations are realized. This allows special ECU functions to be very effectively and with the utmost protection of the device under test. After an automatic run, the test results are stored in CAMEO and in another module, these can then be evaluated and optimized. Various tools have been implemented to detect outliers which occasionally occur in practice, and so-called repeat points can already be measured during the automatic run, which allow a statement about the quality of the measurement. In the so-called raw data validation, the data can be assessed by the user and sometimes automatically by CAMEO and suspicious outliers can be removed. There are various graphical display options available that facilitate the detection of outliers. For the automatic modeling again statistical methods are implemented in CAMEO to make a statement about the so-called confidence level. This shows how well the formed model corresponds to reality and in which areas the model is only little trustworthy. In general, it can be said that with higher measurement accuracy, the number of measurement points can be reduced without the model quality deteriorating severely. After completion of the test run, the motor setting parameters can be optimized on the basis of the measured data and afterwards verification runs can be run to secure this data. In order to use the optimizations in the ECU, a separate map computer is integrated in CAMEO, can be recreated or modified with the maps. These can then be transferred directly to the engine control unit. Another component of CAMEO, which plays an important role in the still to be described virtual engine test bench is the CAMEO extension called RT Extension. It is a software package that can be used to compile MATLAB SIMULINK models and then calculate them in real time (MATLAB-SIMULINK is a commercial platform-independent software from Mathworks Inc., USA). To determine combustion parameters and indicated torque, an indexing system is necessary. The pressure curves in the cylinder are measured using special sensors that can record pressure signals with a bandwidth of up to 800 kHz. With a precise crank angle sensor (resolution of 0.5 ° CA), the pressure curve can be calculated via the crank angle position in the measuring and display unit IndiModul (Indimodul is a product of AVL LIST GMBH). From the cylinder pressure curve, in turn, the combustion center and the indicated torque can be derived. In addition, knocking events are detected by the indexing and assessed according to their intensity. All results can be displayed in the program IndiCOM of the company AVL LIST GMBH and sent to PUMA via a TCP / IP interface 4/16 Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15. In addition, IndiCOM is connected to CAMEO's real-time RT Extension system via a controller area network (CAN) bus to enable, for example, real-time combustion control. As already mentioned, occur in the parameterization of automatic runs again and again major problems that usually lead later to the termination of the test run. The task of the so-called Torquemappings is to find out the exact influences of the individual engine parameters on the torque. For this reason, ignition angle variations are run in the entire operating range, wherein an operating point is set on the test bench and then the ignition angle is varied here. At selected operating points, the mixture composition and, if required, additionally installed adjustment systems of the engine, such as variable camshafts, exhaust gas recirculation, charge movement flaps or the like, are varied. For quick and effective parameterization of the torque structure, CAMEO has a special procedure called iProcedure, which is also able to protect the motor from critical operating conditions. In practice, it can be stated that the parameterization of an automatic run only in the rarest cases is error-free. Very often, clerical errors happen or the appli-cator notices a motor influence during the race, which he was not aware of before. For this reason, an automatic run is usually observed for a longer time at the first start and usually has to be aborted several times in order to change the parameterization. When using the Torquemapping-Procedure of CAMEO very often causes great problems finding the cheapest exhaust gas temperature limit in the automatic run. On the one hand, the limit should be as low as possible in order to prevent a limit violation in the test bench system and the associated abort of the automatic run. On the other hand, in the optimization, however, the entire permissible temperature range up to the upper limit value must be exploited in order to be able to exploit a further power and consumption potential. If the exhaust gas temperature limit is set too low in the automatic run, it may happen that the torque-mapping procedure attempts to achieve a sufficient temperature reserve by further enrichment of the mixture. However, since another desired lambda is parameterized in the control unit, the optimizations for this state are often no longer meaningful. Another difficulty is the setting of setpoints during an automatic run or the adjustment of channels by CAMEO. The applicator has the opportunity to perform such actions in different stages of the test run. If an unfavorable time has been parameterized, this can cause unwanted motor reactions or even a test abort. The problems mentioned can be largely avoided if automatic runs can be tested in advance in a simulation environment to eliminate so many errors in the parameterization in advance can. As a result, expensive test bench time can be saved and another part of the work transferred to the office. The structure of such a virtual engine test stand 11 is shown in Fig. 2. It is essential that the simulation environment from the point of view of the automation system corresponds as much as possible to the real test rig structure and the application engineer can be offered the usual working environment. The application engineer should be able to adopt the parameterized tests as unchanged as possible from the simulator. The automatic runs are parameterized exactly as on the real engine dynamometer 1 in CAMEO and also traversed on this program. CAMEO is connected to PUMA OPEN via an ACI interface, which is why the automation functions exactly the same as on the real engine test bench 1. Also from the perspective of PUMA OPEN there is no difference in the simulation environment to the structure of the real engine dynamometer 1. About EMCON pedal value and brake torque are calculated, which are then sent via the CAN bus to a motor model 12, 5/16 Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 which is integrated in the CAMEO extension module RT Extension. Only the interface is different, but from the point of view of PUMA OPEN this is not a problem. On the CAMEO RT Extension, which is integrated exactly the same as in the real engine test 1, runs in addition the engine model 12 and calculated in real time the engine dynamics. This real-time environment sends values such as speed and shaft torque back to PUMA OPEN via the CAN bus. Since no engine control unit ECU is used in the simulation environment, any necessary ECU functions in the engine model 12 must also be simulated and included in the calculation. For the same reason, the connection of an application system can be omitted in the simulation environment since there is no real ECU. Since PUMA OPEN on the real engine dynamometer 1 always controls the engine 2 via brake torque and pedal value, the engine model 12 in the virtual engine test stand 11 must also be controlled via these two channels. Using a torque balance and the simulated mass inertia of the engine and brake, the model then calculates the current speed, which is sent back to PUMA OPEN as the response variable. Thus, the required model is not actually a pure engine model, but rather the entire test rig structure including the power brake has to be simulated. Since no real engine control unit is present in the simulation environment, no parameters can be adjusted directly in the ECU. However, the engine model 12 must still be able to respond to the setpoint specifications and deliver plausible results. For this purpose, an engine control unit model 18 is required, which fulfills these functionalities. Above all, it must be ensured that the parameters have the same format as in the real ECU and cause the same reactions. In particular, one must consider the absolute or relative adjustment of values. Thus, it may be necessary to emulate complete or at least partially simplified ECU functions within the engine model 12. Another problem arises in the transmission of the specified in CAMEO ECU setpoints to the engine model 12. At the real engine test 1, the parameters are loaded via the application system 10 from the engine control unit ECU and then precisely these channel names parameterized in the test run. In order to simulate the process on the real engine test bench 1 on the virtual engine test bench 11 in the simulation environment, a HiL (Hardware in the Loop) setup would be necessary. In order to find the essential parameterization errors, however, the much simpler solution with an engine control unit model 18 is generally sufficient. If the ECU channels are replaced in the test parameterization and the information is sent directly to the engine model 12, a much simpler structure and reactions can be realized the automatic run remain the same. For the test procedure in the automation system partially values of measuring devices are needed, which therefore must be provided in the simulation environment. Thus, it is necessary to also simulate various meters in the engine model 12, which send their sizes in the correct format to the engine test bench system 3. The values must be calculated by meter simulation models 19, which also necessitates replication of temperatures, pressures and indexing data within the engine model 12. For tasks deviating from torque mapping, the calculation of the exhaust gas composition may also be necessary. There are in principle different ways to build a motor model. In the case of physically based models, an attempt is made to mathematically simulate the physical laws. This has the great advantage that only constructive variables such as dimensions, material constants, etc. are necessary for the parameterization of the model. However, the knowledge of many technical basics such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, mechanics, etc. is required to create such a motor model. Provided that the calculations are correct, however, it is ensured that the course of the individual measured variables is physically correctly mapped. In practice, it is hardly possible to model all influences down to the last detail, since this makes the calculations more and more complex. Very often, differential equations result, whose solutions can only be determined numerically. Since this takes a lot of computing time, the application of the model in real time is often no longer possible. For this reason, simplifications must be made, which ultimately falsify the model result. As an alternative to the physically based models, data-based models are often used in practice. To create a motor model, no knowledge of the physical background is necessary, but only the influence parameters on certain sizes must be known. The exact behavior is measured on the engine test bench and the results are stored in maps. This has the great advantage that the real engine behavior is mapped, but the parameterization of such a model is very expensive, since a sufficient database is required and this is different for each engine. The models found can either be stored in the form of polynomial functions or as so-called lookup tables. For complicated models an attempt is increasingly being made to integrate so-called neural networks. These are modeled on the structure of the human brain. In neural networks, any number of inputs are provided with different weighting factors and added together. The values of the first intermediate layer thus calculated are again weighted, added and stored in a second intermediate layer. After a definable number of intermediate layers, the model outputs are finally calculated by renewed weighting and addition. The structure of a neural network, ie the number of inputs and outputs, as well as the number of intermediate layers and the values contained therein, can be freely defined by the user. During the so-called network training, the weighting factors are adapted to an existing set of measurement data that contains both all inputs and the desired model outputs. Training is basically a numerical optimization task that minimizes the error between the model outputs and the existing training data set. In practice, however, often encounter difficulties, especially the areas between the training data problems. Unlike polynomial functions, neural networks do not ensure the course of the model from the outset. Thus, in some areas, a so-called ""overfitting"" come and in others the network curves due to missing data points from the actual model history. In hybrid models, both physical and data-based models are used, whereby the different advantages of both systems can be utilized. Where it is easily possible to replicate the physical behavior, physically based models are used. To take account of additional influences, data-based correction maps are created, which adapt the model to the real measurement results. In order to test the basic function of the simulation setup and the communication between the individual systems, a separate engine model has been developed, which is adapted to the requirements of the simulation environment. The actual engine model described below for a homogeneously operated gasoline engine consists of several sub-areas. In the intake manifold model, the intake manifold pressure and the incoming air mass are determined via the throttle valve angle and engine speed. The combustion model calculates the output torque and the exhaust gas temperature as a function of air mass, fuel quantity and ignition timing. Furthermore, an emission model which is not further explained here can also be included. SUCTION TUBE MODEL 13 The intake manifold model 13 simulates the intake manifold pressure pSR via physical relationships, wherein in a simplified intake manifold model 13 based on the mass balance, the following relationship applies: Austrian patent office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 VDK ~. -RTV 1- wi * ^ Ki 1 / vJ (3) with vDK ... flow velocity in the throttle valve (m / s) κ ... isentropic exponent (-) Psr ... suction pipe pressure (Pa) Pu. .. ambient pressure (Pa) Ty .. ambient temperature (K) R ... specific gas constant (J / kg K) For the incoming mass flow, the following applies: 0) &lt; = VDK'Aeff Pdk RTrr Pdk Pu \ (4) mzu ... incoming mass flow (kg / s) The effluent mass flow from the intake manifold pressure pSR is at the same time the air which enters the cylinder of the engine. This quantity is dependent on the intake manifold pressure pSR, the displacement and the engine speed, as well as the flow conditions in the intake ports and the timing of the valve train. Since the last two influences are physically very difficult to model and this would later require a huge amount of parameterization, a hybrid model approach represents the best solution in this case. For the purpose of the function, the measurement of a full load curve on the engine test stand is necessary in advance. For this purpose, the engine is fired when the throttle is fully open and the intake air mass is determined at different speeds. From the results, a characteristic is created, which is stored in the intake manifold model 13. The actual air mass for the respective intake manifold pressure pSR is calculated via the so-called intake line. The real engine shows an approximately linear relationship between the intake manifold pressure pSR and the intake air mass, which can be determined very simply via two points. These are the measured air mass at full load and the partial pressure of the inert residual gas PIRG in the cylinder, which represents the intake manifold pressure at which the residual gas remaining in the cylinder prevents the inflow of fresh air. The sucked air mass is at this pressure so 0. Although the Schluckgerade are slightly bent at some speeds, was omitted in the embodiment within the motor model 12 described herein to a correction, since the error in the further calculations hardly affects and is not relevant for the application in the simulation environment. A further simplification in the engine model 12 is obtained by the suppression in the intake manifold at full load can be neglected. The partial pressure of the inert residual gas PIRG in the cylinder is not constant in reality, but is assumed in the engine model 12 for each speed with 200 mbar. 8/16 Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 [0060] The air mass currently flowing out of the intake manifold is thus calculated using the relationship: mab ~ mLuft VL PSR-PIRG 101,3-20 (5) ... outgoing mass flow (kg / s) mLuft n ... air mass flow under full load (kg / s) P_SR ... Suction pipe pressure (kPa) P1RG ... Partialdruck Inert residual gas (kPa) At the end of the function, the air mass is still scaled over the displacement of the engine to map with the same parameterization also similar constructed engines with other displacements can. The third function within the intake manifold model calculates the intake manifold pressure via a mass balance of the incoming and outgoing mass flow. Assuming ideal gas behavior, the following equation applies to the mass or pressure change in the intake manifold: PsrVSR = i ™ to ~ ™ off) ^ SR (®) pSR ... Change in intake manifold pressure (Pa / s) VSR ... Intake pipe volume (m3) TSR ... Temperature in intake manifold (K) For temperature The air in the intake manifold was assumed to have a mean value of 5 ° C above ambient temperature in the model. Thus, the intake manifold pressure pSR is calculated via: } VSR COMBUSTION MODEL 14 The most important output variable of an engine represents the output power. In the simulation, this is calculated in the combustion model 14, again using a hybrid approach: The energy fraction is burned over the burned fuel mass and an efficiency map calculated, which is delivered to the crankshaft. This is called PIH (indicated power in the high-pressure loop) and represents the area in the working loop of a pV diagram (p ... pressure, V ... volume in the working space). The PIH is calculated by the following relationship: 9/16 &gt; Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 (8) PIH - MfäHyTipjH PIH ... indicated power in the high pressure loop (kW) m ^ ... Fuel mass flow (kg / s) Ηυ ... lower calorific value (kJ / kg) 7jpiH ... Efficiency in the high pressure loop (-) [0067 ] The parameterised efficiency takes into account the optimum engine settings and therefore represents the highest possible power yield. For the fuel mass, it must be taken into account that with a rich mixture, the entire amount can not be burned, as there is too little atmospheric oxygen. The fuel mass must therefore be limited: (9) mμ M ... maximum fuel mass flow that can be burned (kg / s) mLufl ... aspirated air mass flow (kg / s) LSt ... stoichiometric air ratio (-) The factor Lst is fuel-dependent and indicates which air mass is needed to completely burn 1 kg of fuel. After the maximum power has been calculated for the respective operating point, this is multiplied by the so-called Zündwinkelwirkungsgrad. In order to simulate this factor physically for each operating state, without having to parameterize a large amount of data, a hybrid model approach was again chosen. About the Zündwinkeleinfluss results in a parabolic curve of the output power. By using a suitable quadratic equation, this fundamental course is ensured: ηΖΖΡ = -0.5 · 22¾ + ZZPrel + 0.5 (10) ηZZP "". Ignition angle efficiency (-) ZZPKl ... relative ignition time (-) The relative ignition time required for the equation is calculated using the relation: 10/16 Austrian Patent Office AT505 326B1 2010-01-15 (11) ZZP ZZPiWiP 77P - 77P ^ rmaxP ^ - * 50% P ZZP ... ignition point (° CA) ZZP50% P ... ignition point at which half the power is delivered (° KW) ZZP ^ p ... ignition point for the maximum power output (° KW) The firing angle for the maximum power output and the ignition timing at which exactly half of the indicated power is delivered are stored in two characteristic diagrams. This can be used to influence the shape of the parabola. In order to prevent the ignition angle efficiency from becoming negative, an additional correction characteristic was implemented in the exemplary embodiment, which changes the course of the curve from ZZP50% p and approaches the value 0. The influence of the mixture composition on the indicated performance was neglected in the combustion model 14 described here, but a lambda efficiency could be introduced as a correction factor. In order to calculate the effective power of the engine, the charge cycle and friction losses still have to be subtracted. The charge cycle is again calculated as a hybrid model by the charge cycle in the pV diagram is assumed to be a rectangle. Thus, to determine these losses, only the knowledge about the stroke volume of the engine, the Saugrohrunterdruck and the exhaust back pressure is necessary. The latter is parameterised as a characteristic depending on the mass flow flowing through. This approximation works quite well in the modeling of conventional gasoline engines. For the simulation of a variable valve train this simplification can not be used. The friction losses of the engine are stored in a characteristic curve, which is normalized by the number of cylinders. This is based on the assumption that the friction changes linearly with the number of cylinders. Thus, after the deduction of the individual losses, the effective power and thus also the effective torque of the motor can be calculated. To simulate the engine dynamometer including the power brake, the engine model 12 further includes a parameterization means 15, a dynamics model 16 including starter model 17, an engine control unit model 18 and a meter simulation model 19: The parameterization means 15 allows the user to assign the engine model 12 to the real engine type to adjust. For this purpose, the knowledge of displacement, number of cylinders, intake manifold, throttle valve diameter and inertia of the engine and the power brake is necessary. These are purely constructive parameters that are normally known for each internal combustion engine (and test rig construction). The entire engine model 12 is scaled over it, which gives the user at all times qualitatively correct results. For the detailed adaptation of the engine model 12 to the real internal combustion engine 2 correction maps can be changed within the individual functions. For this purpose, however, a large number of measured values of the real internal combustion engine is necessary. Furthermore, the user can specify the ambient conditions in the engine model 12 via pressure and temperature. It is also possible to adapt fuel-specific parameters. DYNAMIC MODEL 16 The dynamic model 16 calculates an angular acceleration via a torque balance and the inertia of the internal combustion engine 2 and the power brake 5. In addition, a starter model 17 is integrated, which emits a moment when the start bit is set as a function of the engine speed AT505 326B1 2010-01-15. As a result, the virtual engine can be accelerated to the starting speed as in reality. The characteristic values for the starter are taken from the data sheet of a real starter and must be adapted when parameterizing a larger internal combustion engine. The following physical principle applies to the calculation of the speed change: (1) ΣΜ = Θ · ώ M ... torque (Nm) Θ ... mass moment of inertia (kg m2) ώ ... angular acceleration (rad / s2) [0080 ] From this the formula for the engine speed can be derived: ω - = 1; -dt + ωη (2) ω0 ... initial angular velocity (rad / s) In the engine control unit model 18, all functions of the engine control unit ECU, which are also necessary for the simulation environment, are simulated. As in the real engine control unit ECU, the measured values of the intake air mass, the speed and the pedal value are required as model inputs. From this, the engine control unit model 18 calculates a relative cylinder charge, a throttle valve angle and a desired lambda value, which is stored in a characteristic map. For application purposes, it is possible to change the lambda value. In another map in the engine control unit model 18, the optimum ignition timing is determined, which can be adjusted for application purposes. In addition, the necessary amount of fuel is calculated, which is necessary in the current air mass to reach the predetermined lambda value. MEASURING DEVICE MODEL 19 In particular for internal calculations of the torque mapping procedure of the parameterisation software CAMEO, measured values of the exhaust gas temperature and knocking probabilities are required. These must also be calculated in the simulation environment of the engine model 12 and transmitted to the test bench system 3. For modeling the exhaust gas temperature, a hybrid approach was chosen in the example. The temperature for the optimum engine settings, ie for the maximum power output, are stored in a map. In order to be able to simulate the ignition angle influence on the exhaust gas temperature, the power difference is converted into a temperature difference as a result of the ignition angle efficiency. The evaluation of data of a real internal combustion engine shows that about half of the energy is dissipated via the exhaust gas. The physical relationship can therefore be approximated by the following equation: 12/16"
