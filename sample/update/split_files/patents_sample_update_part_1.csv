93,DE-60030717-T2,ADAPTIVELY ADJUSTED OPTICAL CORRELATOR AND METHOD ,2000,"Field of the invention The This invention relates to optical image processors or correlator systems, the coherent light use, spatial Light modulators and Fourier transform optics, to process information or recognize patterns. Description of related prior art It has long been known that two-dimensional, spatial Fourier transform techniques can be used to Process images. For example, pattern recognition often becomes by working with the Fourier transform of a spatially varying Image, in contrast to the original image, relieved. In particular, generate optical correlators the two-dimensional correlation of an input image to a reference picture. A high level of correlation at one localized area within the image frame shows a detection of the reference image in this area. The correlation function is easiest by multiplying the Fourier transform a picture in the frequency domain with a ""filter"" performed what a frequency domain representation a reference picture or pictures. The resulting (two-dimensional) Frequency function will then return transformed to the spatial domain. Although such processing can be done digitally, it can do much faster through an optical Fourier transform of the Image performed become. Such high-speed image processing finds numerous applications in various fields, such as Safety, aviation, biomedical diagnostics and artificial Intelligence. Optical correlators using two-dimensional Fourier transform optics and active electronic spatial light modulators (SLMs) have been used to perform two-dimensional high-speed pattern recognition. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,311,359 to Lucas et al. Describes an optical correlator system having a source of coherent light and a plurality of active and passive optical components disposed along a folded zigzag optical path. The active optical components are an input SLM, a filter SLM and a pixel-like photodetector (usually a CCD device); each of these active elements is typically a field of electronically addressable, active pixels arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The passive components include reflective focusing mirrors and polarizers. In the patented device, the optical path is a tunnel contained within a block of transparent ceramics having an extremely low temperature expansion coefficient (7 × 10-H/ ° C). 1illustrates the prior art optical correlator of the Lucas patent, in which a coherent electromagnetic radiation source (typically a laser) is used.10that are inside a solid, optical support body12is arranged, a collimated and polarized, coherent radiation beam14generated. The spotlight14meets a pixel-like, reflective input SLM16and will, by whatever pattern, electronically on the input SLM16considered, modulated. The modulation is spatially distributed. As discussed in the patent, when a magneto-optic SLM is used, the pixels of the SLM are individually electronically modulated to permit rotation of the polarization of the reflected light as a function of the input signal addressed to that pixel cause. Such an SLM also requires an input polarizer and output polarizer that work as an analyzer (not in FIG1shown). The result is that some pixels of the field effectively absorb more while others reflect more, as a function of the electronic modulating pattern that is applied. The modulated beam14is reflected and propagated to a first, focusing mirror18, The beam14is from the first, focusing mirror18is reflected and applied to a filter SLM20focused. Provided that the first focusing mirror18has the correct focal length to the input SLM16on the filter SLM20It is a well-known consequence of the wave optics that the image is at the plane of the filter SLM20optically by a spatial Fourier transform into a frequency domain representation F (u, v) of the input image f (x, y) (where x and y are the spatial coordinates of the input SLM16and u and v are the spatial coordinates of the filter SLM20are) is transformed. It must be understood that the Fourier transform, which is referenced throughout, is a Fourier transform of a function (intensity of modulation) coincident with the position (in this case the position on the face of the input SLM16) varies. This Fourier transform of a spatially varying function should not be confused with the Fourier transform of a time varying function that is more familiar to engineers. The flat surfaces of the SLMs will actually present functions that vary in two dimensions; consequently, the transformed image will be a two-dimensional Fourier transform representing the frequency components of a two-dimensional image in two dimensions. The Fourier transformed image attached to the filter SLM20The filter is typically the previously obtained Fourier transform of a particular reference and therefore consists of a pattern of frequency components listed on a two-dimensional surface An input image to a reference image may be obtained by using the product of the Fourier transformed input image and the Fourier transformed reference image, as described in the prior art patent The product F (u, v) .H (u, v) (where H (u, v) is the filter) is then passed through a second focusing mirror22on a photodetector24focused. The resulting image on the photodetector24is the Fourier transform of the product image, which gives the correlation of the input image to the reference image (with an inverse of x and y coordinates at the detector). The correlation of the input function and the filter function thus appears on the photodetector24as a two-dimensional, correlated, optical intensity function. The previous correlator described above must be precisely optically aligned for best operation. The optical components comprising the input SLM16, the filter SLM20, the photodetector24and the mirrors18and22, must be in an optical alignment with the beam14to be adjusted. The necessary adjustments require great precision and accuracy to bring the assembly into optimal optical alignment. The alignment, once aligned, is often difficult to maintain as it is affected by thermally induced stresses applied to the optical device and the coherent light source. Mechanical stress and vibration induced stress can also cause undesirable misalignment effects. The most critical alignment in the earlier correlators is, as Lucas has recognized, the adjustment of the position of the filter SLM20relative to the input SLM16, This setting is critical in the geometry of the Lucas patent. The patented correlator lists a specific spatial frequency component of the input image to a specific point in the focal plane of the first focusing mirror18on. For proper operation, each specific input image frequency component must be further modulated (multiplied) by the specific, corresponding filter frequency component. This requires the specific frequency components of the input image to be specific pixels of the filter SLM20be listed. For the best operation, even a more stringent condition must be met: the specific frequency component of the input image must be listed at the center of the corresponding filter pixel. This requires that the position of the filter SLM20in x, y and z directions relative to the input SLM16must be adjusted, the accuracy is typically on the order of a few microns. In the earlier, Optical correlators make it difficult to precisely position the input and filter SLMs. Their position, once positioned, is difficult with regard to unavoidable mechanical and thermal stresses and changes to maintain in the ambient conditions. Summary of the invention The The invention is an adaptive alignment method and apparatus an optical correlator. in the Contrast, the coherent Beam into the optical array at a fixed angle, as with earlier ones Correlators, introduce, used the invention is a beam deflection device that dynamically the Beam deflection in dependence a correction signal varies. A feedback system detects a misalignment and provides a correction signal that causes the beam deflection device the optical correlator back in brings a suitable orientation. Around Dynamically an optical correlator (the one input SLM, a Filter SL and a photodetector includes), the invention uses a test sample to to modulate the input SLM, since at the same time an independently Fourier-transformed frequency domain reference pattern is applied to the filter SLM. If the optical path is correct is aligned, including the critical alignment of the input and filter SLMs, is a two-dimensional Fourier-transformed image of the input SLM test pattern be focused on the filter SLM, with frequency components to the corresponding frequency components in the independently transformed Frequency-domain reference pattern are aligned. The resulting image on the photodetector becomes in this case, a sharp intensity peak at a predefinable Be a place. On the other hand, if the optical alignment is light Mistakes or drifts away from alignment will become the transformed test pattern is not suitable for the corresponding Align frequency components of the frequency domain reference pattern to the filter SLM. In this case, the resulting image becomes the photodetector become slightly diffuse and / or of relatively lower intensity. The Signal from the photodetector output is used to provide a feedback signal derive that for The error in the orientation is characteristic. The feedback signal is then processed and a suitable correction signal then becomes applied to an electromechanical actuator field, the direction slightly of the coherent Beam changes. This slight change in the beam angle easily represents the orientation of the transformed Test pattern image on the filter SLM, thereby dynamically the optical correlator back in alignment. Independent return loops are preferably for a two-dimensional setting in the preferred orthogonal Directions of a beam deflection provided. During an operation of the optical Correlator, the alignment is occasionally tested to a maintain proper alignment. A return loop with occasional sampling functions as a hill climbing servo seeks the highest correlation peak Test patterns and reserves a consideration of the correlation peak regardless of a variation in the thermal or mechanical environment.

FIG. detailed description The Invention dynamically directs an optical correlator by introducing a coherent beam in the optical arrangement at an angle that is dynamic through a return system is set off. The return system detects a deviation of the correlator from a given orientation characteristic - typically optimal alignment - and supplies a suitable correction signal to a beam deflection device, back to the correlator in an optimal orientation. 2FIG. 4 illustrates an overview at a system level of the invention. A coherent radiation beam, typically provided by a laser30, becomes an optical correlator32by a beam deflection device34introduced. A digital computer36or equivalent digital logic circuits provide a test pattern38and a frequency domain reference pattern40to the optical correlator32, The optical correlator32like the prior art optical correlators discussed above, modulates the coherent beam with the test pattern, optically modulates the modulated beam into a frequency domain transform of the test pattern38and visually compares the frequency domain transform of the test pattern38with the frequency domain reference pattern40Being independent through the digital computer36is supplied. The comparison of the two patterns is performed in the frequency domain representation and results in a beam that is due to the match or correlation of the test pattern38with the frequency domain reference pattern40is modulated. The image representation of the correlation, which indicates the accuracy of the orientation of the correlator, is then optically transformed back into a spatial domain representation and detected by a photodetector to obtain an output. The output of the optical correlator32is through interface electronics42transformed into a digital form and through the digital computer36saved. The digital computer36processes this output information and performs  a hill-climbing servo system that detects deviations from a given alignment characteristic and provides a suitable digital correction signal (or signals)44derives. The correction signal (or signals)44gets into appropriate, analogue levels through the interface electronics42converted and a resulting feedback signal46controls the beam deflection device34to adjust the angle of the coherent beam, which is the optical correlator32brings back into alignment. 3represents an optical correlator32which is a beam deflection device34for correcting system misalignments. Elements that are analogous to elements used in1in the prior art are indicated by the dashed (') numbers corresponding to the numbers of the prior art analogous elements. In the embodiment shown, the beam deflecting device is34an electromechanical actuator field mounted on an optical support body12 'is mounted. The actuator field in turn carries a laser arrangement30using collimation optics and an apodizing filter. The collimating optics and the apodizing filter (both not shown) are conventionally used to produce a well-collimated beam14 'with an approximately constant intensity over a given radial beam profile (which is preferably larger than the optically active surface of the input SLM16 'is) to receive. The optical support body12 'carries the active and passive, optical elements that provide a folded, optical zigzag path for the beam14 'define. In the embodiment shown, the optical support body comprises12 'tunnel50.52.54.56and58for the optical path of the beam14 ', Although a solid, transparent, optical carrying body12 'Alternatively, tunnels reduce the disturbances caused by inhomogeneities in the solid material of the body. The beam14 'that of the laser assembly30goes out at an angle through the input SLM16 'at the end of the tunnel50reflected; the beam14 'then propagates back to a first, focusing mirror18 'at the end of the tunnel52, The beam14is again at an angle from the focusing mirror18 'reflects and propagates through a first polarizer60in the tunnel54to a filter SLM20 'at the end of the tunnel54where he has a transformed image of the information on the beam14through the input SLM16 'are modulated forms. The beam14 'is further modulated and filtered by the SLM20 'reflected. Next, the twice modulated beam propagates to a second, focusing mirror22 'at the end of the tunnel56and is reflected a fourth time before passing through a second polarizer61in the tunnel58propagated to a photodetector24 ', at the end of the tunnel58to arrive, which detects the output (correlated) signal. The optical zigzag path to which the beam14What follows from the optical arrangement described above is a suitable geometry, but is only one of many possible geometries that can be used in connection with the invention. Different folded, polygonal or rectilinear geometries could also be used, for example. The beam deflection device34is typically an electromechanical actuator field that exists between the laser array30and the optical support body12 'is interposed. When a feedback signal to the beam deflection device34is applied, it tilts the laser, thereby causing the angle of the optical path of the beam14 'slightly shifts. This is due to the shifted, optical path62the angle of which is represented by an angle α relative to the original, optical path of the beam14 'is shifted, as shown. A slight change in the entrance angle is increased as the beam passes through the translated optical path62propagates what causes the image formed on the filter SLM20 ', by Δx shifts. As in4is shown, the beam can also by the beam deflection device34in the y-direction, resulting in a shift in the image position of Δy relative to the filter SLM20 'leads. A shift in the image position on the filter SLM20 'in turn affects the orientation of the transformed image to the filter SLM20 'and gives rise to a corresponding change in the output image at the photodetector24 ', To allow for slight displacements in the beam incidence angle, the diameter of the collimated beam should preferably be sufficiently larger than the input SLM16 'so that the input SLM16 'completely lit, irrespective of any beam shifts, most preferably with an approximately constant illumination intensity. In order to detect deviations of the optical correlator described above from the optimal alignment, a test pattern and a corresponding frequency domain reference pattern (or ""filter"") must be used simultaneously to detect the input SLM16 'and the filter SLM20 'each modulate. These SLMs are typically, as described in the prior art, pixelized addressable arrays of active electro-optic modulating elements, usually arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The individual pixels of the input SLM16 'who  electronically modulated so that, by their reflections, together they form the beam with a pattern, such as an annular pattern63represented in5a(as an example). The ring-shaped pattern63denotes the part of the input SLM16 'which is to be modulated to reflect incident light. The focusing mirror18 'has a focal length that is the beam from the input SLM16 'on the filter SLM20 'maps what the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the input image (as reflected by the input SLM16 'modulated) on the filter SLM20 'generated. While the test pattern is the beam at the input SLM16 'modulates, a frequency domain reference pattern is used to filter the SLM20 'to modulate. The light coming from the filter SLM20 'Accordingly, the frequency domain reference pattern should preferably be the independently obtained Fourier transform, taken in two dimensions, of the input test pattern, resulting in a frequency domain Representation of the spatial test pattern leads. The Fourier transform of the test pattern should preferably be independent prior to applying the test pattern to the input SLM16 ', by a digital computation, an optical transformation, or other conventional transformation techniques.5brepresents a suitable reproduction of the pattern, which by a Fourier transform of the5ais obtained in two dimensions;5bwould therefore be a suitable frequency domain reference pattern to make it (at the filter SLM20 ') together with the5a(at the input SLM16 ') to use. The output on the photodetector24 'when a spatial test pattern and the corresponding frequency domain reference pattern are present and appropriate to the SLMs16 'and20 ', respectively, are a bright peak that will be through a spot of light centered at a particular location on its pixelized matrix. The high autocorrelation display will be a very focused and localized high intensity output peak signal. This situation is through5cshown in the stain65the peak signal at the exact center of the photodetector matrix24 'displays. Any deviation from a perfect optical alignment of the SLMs, caused for example by a deflection of the beam, will cause the output to lose focus and intensity and become more diffuse, indicating a decrease in correlation. The position of the peak will also be light on the matrix of the output photodetector24'move. As a result, by applying a spatial test pattern and a test pattern of a corresponding frequency domain representation (or ""filter""), a comparison signal will pass through the photodetector24 'which indicates the accuracy of the optical alignment. The comparison signal is then used to derive a suitable feedback or correction signal, which when applied to the beam deflection device34to bring the optical correlator back to an optimal orientation. The feedback signal used to maintain optimum alignment is preferably implemented as a ""hill-climbing"" servo system, in which system at least one oscillating ""dither"" signal is produced66low level, plotted against time in6, to the beam deflection device34applied to an oscillating deflection of the coherent beam14 'to create. Preferably, two separate orthogonal dither signals would be sequentially applied to produce independent deflections of the beam in x and y directions. The feedback settings would then be performed independently in each of the independent directions. For simplicity, a dimension of adjustment is in2but the invention is not limited thereto. In7sets the output curve68the output of the photodetector24 '(on the vertical axis) as a function of the coherent beam deflection14 '(For example, as a function of the deflection angle α in3) with a test pattern representing the input SLM16 'modulates, and a corresponding frequency domain reference, the filter SLM20 'modulated. A maximum exists at one point70, the angle of an optimal alignment. A hill climbing servo method is preferably used to determine the optimal point of alignment (point70) to search. Its operation can be generally understood by first considering two specific cases. For the first specific case, it is assumed that initially the deflection angle slightly deviates from the optimum such that the output is the one at the point on the line71, slightly to the left of the center in7, is. A little disturbance or a ""dither""66between phases72and74in6is oscillated, is applied to the beam deflection device34applied, which causes the intensity of the correlation peak on the photodetector24 'by oscillating between the two levels, marked with76and78(shown in both6bas well as7), appeals. It should be understood that the position of the correlation peak can easily move during deflection; the intensity of the correlation peak is determined by finding  the maximum intensity on the matrix of the photodetector24 'selected (for example, by processing the output of the photodetector with the digital computer36as discussed below). The first, sampled intensity level76represents the intensity of the correlation peak sampled during the dither phase72, the other of the corresponding peak, sampled during the dither phase74, dar. Disturbance or jitter of the deflection in this manner becomes a time variation in the intensity of a correlation peak80, measured at the photodetector24 ', produce. The intensity is in relation to the time in6bprinted (over time on the horizontal axis). The correlation peak intensity80oscillates in phase with the dither signal66, A subtraction of the intensity80, sampled during the negative dither phase, of the intensity80, sampled during the positive dither phase, yields a positive correlation signal indicating that the orientation angle (α or β) is too low (for example, α is to the left of the center). For the second special case, the initial assumption is changed here, provided that the beam angle deviates slightly to the other side of the optimum, so that the correction peak intensity is on the line81in7is centered. An application of the dither signal66will then cause the intensity of the correction peak between levels82and84on the negative loop side of the curve68oscillates. The obtained dither intensity87of the correlation peak is in6cshown. The intensity87oscillates between levels82and84as shown, the phase being related to the jitter reference66vice versa, what by considering the6cand the6acan be seen. In this case, subtracting gives the intensity87, sampled during the negative dither phase of the intensity87, sampled during the positive dither phase, a negative correction signal, indicating that the deflection angle (α or β) is too high. Only if the orientation of the correlator system is such that the intensity of the correction peak is precisely at the peak70is the output curve (Optimum), the correlation peak intensity is the same for both deflections of the dither signal66since it is of the optimum by the same amount on both sides of the peak70will differ (assuming a symmetric curve68). This situation results in a shallow peak intensity signal88(6d) indicating optimal alignment. The perturbation signal thus results in a manner of detecting the slope or deviation of the output signal with respect to an angle of the coherent beam (for example, α or β). By looking for the deviation from zero, a maximum of the output signal can be found. Any deviation of the optimum alignment of the array from the optimum will cause unequal photodetector output in the positive and negative excursions of the dither signal. Subtracting the peak detector output sampled at the negative emigration from the peak detector output sampled at the positive emigration provides a suitable correction signal for feedback to the beam deflector34to the optical correlator32to bring back into alignment. In the preferred embodiment, the invention employs independent beam deflection and feedback systems on multiple axes, preferably perpendicular to each other, which allows correction of the correlator in, for example, both the x and y directions as indicated in FIGS3and4, allows. The independent orientations should preferably be performed individually and sequentially, for example, first an x-shake and then a y-shake, under the control of the digital computer36, 8thFigure 10 illustrates in greater detail an embodiment of a complete correlator system of the invention comprising functional blocks100of the computer, interface electronics102and an optical correlator arrangement104, The functional computer blocks100can be in a software through the digital computer36or equivalent, logic circuits are executed. A data transfer sequencing logic106controls the overall timing, ignoring occasional frames for adaptive alignment, while maintaining the full throughput of the optical correlator for normal operation. The data transfer sequencing logic106also generates at least one digital dither signal. Preferably, two separate digital dither signals are applied to two reversible counters: counters108for trembling in the x direction and counters110for the trembling in the y direction. The outputs of the counters108and110get into an analog voltage through digital-to-analog converter (DACs)112and114converted and to interface electronics102comprising an inverter and summing amplifier circuits (described below), which in turn comprise the beam deflection device34drive. At the same time, this dither signal is sent to the beam deflection device34applied, the input test pattern and the frequency domain reference pattern are applied to the input SLM16 'and the filter SLM20 ', respectively, by an SLM and  CCD control logic block115(preferably executed by the digital computer36). The resulting output from the photodetector24 'is controlled by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)116for easier processing by the digital computer36(or the equivalent, digital logic) converted. The entire matrix of output levels is converted and becomes the digital computer36entered. The maximum amplitude detection logic118(preferably through the digital computer36is executed) compares the digitized photodetector output values corresponding to each individual pixel on the matrix of the photodetector24 'and finds the highest value on the matrix of the photodetector. This value is assigned to the peak correlation point. The position of the output peak, and hence the pixel address of the peak, may vary slightly during adjustment. The two peak values, one corresponding to each phase of the jitter, are detected and stored. Dual values (for each dimension) are then passed through functional comparator blocks120(for the x-correction) and122(for the y-correction) compared. If the orientation of the optical device deviates from the optimum, the double stored values for that dimension will be unequal and the appropriate functional comparator block120or122will generate a correction signal that is either positive or negative. The correction signal passing through the functional comparator blocks120and122is output, the direction of a count for reversible counter108(x-channel) and110(y channel). The reversible counters count pulses generated by the data transfer sequencing logic106generated for this purpose. The outputs of the reversible counter108and110containing the current position information for the actuator field32are held by DACs112and114(one for each channel), which produces duplicate analogue correction voltages: one for the x-direction, one for the y-direction. The manner of applying the correction voltages will depend on the specific geometry and characteristics of the beam deflection device34and a wide variety of arrangements are possible. The8thand9represent only one such possibility. In the embodiment shown, the beam deflection device sets34electromechanical actuators140.142.146and148which are positioned on diagonals relative to the x, y coordinate system and together form an actuator field. Inverting amplifiers124and126generate complementary signals by inverting the analog correction voltages. The analog correction voltages and the complementary signals then become in a cross-connected network of summing amplifiers130.132.134and138summed up to return control voltages158.160.162and164to create. These feedback control voltages in turn generate suitable x and y correction movements of the electromechanical actuators. In the embodiment which is in8th2, the feedback drive voltages are converted in a movement in the actuator field by extending or reducing oppositely positioned piezoelectric segments. For example, to move the deflector in the negative x direction, the segments would140and142be contracted while the segments146and148would be extended. 9In more detail, illustrates an actuator field included in the beam deflection device34of the invention can be used. The entire field (beam deflection device34) is composed of four actuators arranged in quadrants, each shaped like an arcuate quarter section, and all four together forming a broken ring. Each arcuate quarter section preferably comprises a plurality of piezoelectric layers154stacked in a laminar fashion that together form an actuator. Every piezoelectric layer154is preferably formed of a piezoelectric ceramic material. In the side cross section, which is in9can be represented, two actuator segments142and146be seen. electrode layers156, preferably metallized, are between each pair of piezoelectric layers154interposed. Alternating electrode layers156of the actuator146are with the feedback control voltage158connected; Similar are alternating electrode layers of the actuator142with the feedback control voltage160connected. actuators148and140not in9are shown are connected analogously. The stacking of the multilayer piezoelectric material allows greater elongation and shortening in response to an applied voltage. The Use of piezoelectric ceramic actuators is sufficient known and described in numerous sources. See for example Piezoelectric Ceramics, J. van Randeraat (Publications Dept., Ferroxcube Corporation, Saugerties, N.Y. 1974). Piezoelectric, ceramic Materials or actuators are widely available commercially, for example from Aura Ceramics (Minneapolis, MN), Polytec PI, Piezo System Jena (Germany), or Philips Electronic Components (available in USA over Signetics Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). In the embodiment illustrated in FIG3, the actuator field works9as a beam deflection device, by the laser arrangement30relative to the optical support body12 'is moved. In this embodiment, the laser arrangement is30firmly on the beam deflection device32mounted, which in turn is movable on the optical support body12 'is attached. Applying a voltage to the actuators of the beam deflection device34the actuators lengthen or contract as necessary to thereby cause the laser to collapse30to move and the beam14 'distract. It will be readily appreciated that other arrangements enabling beam deflection are possible, either by electromechanical actuators or by other devices. Beam deflection can be easily made by moving a mirror, a lens, a fiber optic coupling, or a prism, as an example, as opposed to moving the light source, as described above. A distraction could easily be done by moving a focusing mirror18 ', for example, be made. These and other methods of deflecting the beam are also within the scope of the invention. It is only necessary that the beam deflector provide sufficiently fine control, preferably so as to align the transformation image with the filter SLM20 'within less than a pixel diameter of a filter SLM. In some applications, the apparatus and method described above may be used to dynamically align a working optical correlator in the following manner: during normal operation of an optical correlator, alignment must be occasionally tested. Alignment can be accomplished with only a very small interruption to the normal operations of the correlator. During performing sequential, multi-frame optical correlations (correlating input data to reference data in the frequency domain to produce output information based on the correlation), the operation of the correlator may occasionally be interrupted, preferably under the control of the digital computer36for a few frames of adaptive alignment. The intervals between such adaptive alignment frames should be determined by the thermal and mechanical environment of the device. The alignment can typically be done quickly, requiring only a low clock cycle and resulting in the loss of only a few frames of the activity of the correlator. After the alignment process is performed, the correlator is switched back to its normal optical processing tasks until the next alignment interval. While certain embodiments The invention has been illustrated and described, numerous Variations and alternative embodiments Professionals in the field. Accordingly It is envisaged that the invention will not be limited only by the information provided by attached claims limited is."

Pursuant to the computer program, a mathematical vector lists electrical current values which correlate with the degaussing coils. A genetic algorithm is executed through a certain number of generational iterations in order to find a solution vector which will optimize the parameter(s). Every generational population has the same number of vectors. An initial population is randomly engendered, and successive populations are engendered through a biasedly random process wherein each vector has associated therewith a parenthood selection probability which is commensurate with its fitness.

124,DE-60128279-T2,Optical sensor for the detection of several analytes ,2000,"The The present invention relates to devices and methods for simultaneously analyzing multiple analytes in fluids and in particular, to devices and methods for simultaneous Determine the concentration of multiple analytes in an unknown Fluid sample using an optical interrogation. The Analytical chemistry is and has been instrumental in making it worldwide Billions of people a healthier and to allow a more pleasant life. For example, to protect the environment, samples of water, air, Microorganisms, fibers from plants and animals analyzed. In the medical Area will be samples of body fibers and physiological fluids routinely analyzed to provide patient information for diagnostic as well as for monitoring purposes. In the past, analyzes were mainly done by collecting samples and delivering it to a laboratory for analysis using greater, expensive equipment carried out. In other cases For example, the analyzes were even more wet using chemistry chemically Reactions performed. To the concentration or presence of different analytes in an unknown sample, the unknown sample, such as A liquid, often split into many fractions and analyzed analyte per analyte become. Thus, the analysis of multiple analytes is unknown Sample with difficulty and time consuming. Some examples of instruments that can detect multiple analytes simultaneously are AVL Opti CCA, Chiron Centaur, Instrumentation Laboratory GEM 201, I-STAT Portable Analyzer, etc. AVL Opti CCA is a portable analyzer that provides the measurement of pH, total hemoglobin, Oxygen saturation, blood gas and electrolyte parameters. The analyzer uses an Opti-CCA cassette system, which is a disposable cassette system incorporating optical sensing technology. The cassette contains optical fluorescence sensors, one each for pH, PCO2, PO2, Na+, K+, iCa++(ionic calcium) and Cl-. The analytes SO2and tHb (total hemoglobin) are measured using optical absorbance. Also Diameterics' IRMA is a portable analyzer that measures pH, PCO2, PO2, Na+, K+, iCa++, Cl-, Hct (hematocrit) and glucose. Diameterics' IRMA has disposable cartridges designed to provide various combinations of these parameters using an electrochemical sensor for each parameter. The glucose cartridge is a standalone cartridge utilizing optical reflectance technology. The I-STAT device also uses cartridges based on electrochemical sensors, one for each parameter. For different combinations of the parameters pH, PCO2,PO2,Na+,K+,iCa++,Cl-,Hct, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN = blond urea nitrogen) include and creatinine, several different cartridges are available. It should be noted that although a large number of parameters can be measured using these analyzers, none of these analyzers can be used to analyze all parameters using a single cartridge. In addition, analyzers often use a combination of both optical and electrochemical sensing technologies. Also if a simultaneous analysis of a plurality of analytes already possible is, the analytical tools are often complex. For example, bring older procedures for optically detecting multiple analytes, a use of multiple optical sensors with each of which for detecting a optimized for specific analytes. The sensors are designed around for the analyte they target to be specific and none other analyte that may be present in the sample. A disadvantage of such processes is that they are highly specific Sensor must be designed. A design of such a high specificity is costly and time consuming and not always convenient. Furthermore can such designed sensors only in well-defined samples, which are known to be non-interfering species of analytes to be used. A failure of ensuring one such specificity could be at the sensor too unreliable Take measurements. For example, you can Some blood glucose sensors are not used when acetaminophen present in the blood sample. Another disadvantage of this design is the fact that each of the sensors has a different polling method required. For example, a pH sensor on an optical Absorbance of an indicator at a given wavelength, while an oxygen sensor based on fluorescence quenching at a different wavelength can. For a glucose detection may need to be a third process, such as Colorimetry, etc., for other analytes. As a result It may be that the instrument is used to analyze multiple components complicated, expensive, unwieldy and due to a high power consumption can be marked. Recently, Wolfbeis et al. Described with ""Set of luminescent decay time based chemical sensors for clinical applications"", Sensors and Actuators B 51 (1998) 17-24, a method for producing optical Sen  multiple species that can be interrogated with a single optical source and a single detector. Although it would seem that an instrument based on this concept should be simple and inexpensive, the sensors themselves are highly nonselective. Wolfbeis et al. Have shown that these sensors respond to pH. Therefore, such sensors would be inappropriate in an environment where the pH changes. In addition, older literature, such as. For example, ""Non-Crosslinked Organosilicon Matrix for Luminescent Quenching based Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensors"" SPIE Proceedings, Vol. 1886, (1993), by Mauze et al., Shows that the luminophore of these sensors is also sensitive to oxygen, such as those described by Wolfbeis et al Therefore, they are not applicable per se to measurements in a changing oxygen environment. Another type of legacy sensing device uses arrays of sensors that are highly nonspecific to the volatile analytes in the sample. Such devices are z. B. in theU.S. Patent 5,698,089, by doingU.S. Patent 5,788,833, and in Anal Chem. 1986, 58, 3058-3066 by Ballantine et al. Such arrays consist of sensors that have physical, optical or electrical properties such. B. density, refractive angles or electrical resistance, which change in relation to the concentrations of the species that penetrate to the sensing element of the sensors change. The changes in such properties are measured and the data are analyzed using pattern recognition methods to determine the concentration of each species. Such sensors have a limited dynamic range dictated by the characteristics of the detection region. In addition, these acquisition arrays can only be used to analyze volatile species. These sensors respond to any species that penetrates the detection region. Calibration models or sets of exercises must be designed to encompass all such species that might be present in the sample. Thus, they are susceptible to interference when encountering a special species. a Designing a sensor that responds to just one analyte, is a very difficult task. Many sensors with which experiments had been abandoned since interference could not be removed by one or more other analytes. Often it is just one species that interferes with the measurement. In such cases Attempts have been made to provide a sensor specifically for the interfering Species without interference from others, mathematical for interference is correct to design. However, such an additional sensor requires a new method for interrogating the sensor. This increases the complexity of the instrument. This challenge is particularly daunting if a large number must be measured by analytes and many species with each other interfere. Often it is not possible to do a highly specific Sensor for to produce an interfering species. TheWO 00/04372discloses a system for rapid characterization of multi-analyte fluids comprising a light source, a sensor array, and a detector. The sensor is formed from a support member into which a plurality of resonators can be formed. Positioned in the resonators are a series of chemically sensitive particles which may be constructed to generate a signal when a receptor coupled to the particle interacts with the analyte. Using pattern recognition methods, the analytes can be characterized in a multi-analyte fluid. According to one The first aspect of the present invention is an apparatus such as it is claimed in claim 1. According to one second aspect of the present invention is a method such as it is claimed in claim 8 provided. It There is a need for a reliable one Method for analyzing several species in a sample under Using a simple instrument, eg. B. a single source detector unit. About that It is also desirable Make sure the devices are not interactible Way to the other unvisited known or unknown Species that may be present in the sample. It is also he wishes, that the device is non-volatile Species as well as the volatile ones Species is applicable in the sample. The present invention fulfills these requirements Requirements and provides a method for simultaneous analysis multiple analytes (eg, the analyte in a sample of a liquid of unknown composition). The present method uses a plurality of sensors to generate a plurality of analytes with some of the analytes may be with The sensors that detect, interfere with, and deliver other analytes the responses of the sensors in such a relationship that the analytes, despite the fact that the analytes may interact with each other interfere, be detected accurately. In In one aspect, the present invention provides a simultaneous device Analyzing multiple analytes in an unknown fluid (i.e. a sample of unknown liquid composition). The device includes a plurality of sensors, each for contacting with a sample of the unknown fluid. The majority of sensors includes groups of sensors, each group having a specific Targeted analyte and includes one or more sensors, the include an analyte-specific chemical that is more specific with an analyte as interacting with other analytes to be analyzed. Everyone Sensor in a group has a different chemical, which interacts specifically with the analyte. In the device is a Light source for providing light directed to the sensors is present to effect a light interaction with the sensors. Differences in the sensors lead to differences in the light interaction with the sensors. It will Detectors used to control the light interaction through the sensors to determine. It becomes a processor for analyzing the light interaction used by the sensors to cause interference in the light interaction to take into account between the analytes determines the concentration of each of the analytes in the unknown fluid becomes. The present invention also provides a method for simultaneous Analyze multiple analytes in an unknown fluid. In In one aspect, the present method involves transforming the analysis a big one Number of analytes in the analysis of a smaller number of chemicals, such that the concentration of this smaller number of chemicals analyzed using a simple detection method can be with you. In one embodiment, certain Ions over a chemical composition that measures the pH in a sensor changed by the ions, detected. In a further embodiment Certain chemicals are over a chemical composition that is the oxygen concentration changed in the sensor, detected. Under Use of the method of the present invention may advantageously A compact acquisition tool used to increase concentration or the presence of a plurality of analytes simultaneously even though it may be that the analytes interact with each other interfere. Because of the unique feature of using a chemical conversion, to capture many analytes in the detection of some common chemicals or ions (eg, oxygen and To change hydrogen ions), can be the same chemical composition or detection method used to determine the concentration or presence of this to determine a few common chemicals and ions. As a result can use a smaller number of light sources to interrogate the sensors and a smaller number of detector types for detecting changes used in the sensors. Such factors lead to simpler and more compact devices for analyzing analytes. The present method is particularly useful in medicine. An example of fluids that could be analyzed using the devices and methods of this invention is blood. Expedient measurement of blood analytes significantly improves the ease and simplicity of monitoring the health of patients. Several analytes to be measured in such an exemplary fluid may include pH, PO2, PCO2, K+, Na+, Ca++, Mg++, glucose, lactate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hot, Hb, bilirubin, therapeutic Include drugs, drugs of abuse, etc. Although the example described later relates to an aqueous fluid, the invention is also directed to analyzing other fluids, such as e.g. As gases or other liquid applicable. The invention applies in particular to a skin piercing device that is able to transport fluid out of the skin. Furthermore, the present invention is useful for analyzing fluids in non-medical areas, such as non-medical environments. As environmental samples, samples hei manufacturing processes, etc. applicable. It Referring now to the drawings, a number of preferred embodiments will be described of the invention. Show it: 1an embodiment of a scheme of a device that is used in the present invention. 2an embodiment of a sensor array (eg, sensor array) used in the present invention. 3a graph showing absorbance and luminescence of a dye at different pH conditions. 4an embodiment of the light source and the detector assembly device, in this  Invention can be used. 5an embodiment of a sensor arrangement used in the present invention. 6a schematic representation of an embodiment of an apparatus for determining the concentration or the presence of analytes, which is used in the present invention. The The present invention includes a method for obtaining multiple analytes to more appropriately detect in an unknown fluid sample. A special Advantage of the invention is the fact that they are the interference of different analytes among each other in the analysis of considered unknown sample. 1shows an embodiment of an apparatus of the present invention for simultaneously detecting multiple analytes. The detection device10includes a sensor arrangement12by a light source14, the light of a suitable wavelength profile (frequency profile) on the sensor array12directs and focuses on the same. The light source14is preferably by a processor16controlled to provide light in the desired wavelength and duration to the sensor device12interrogate, causing a light interaction with the sensors in the sensor array12is effected. A light detector18detects light resulting from the light interaction at the sensor array12results. Signals from the light detector18become a processor, preferably the same processor16, for analysis, for determining the presence and / or concentration of analytes in the unknown sample. It is well known that some analytes cause absorption of light of particular wavelengths and some analytes cause changes in the fluorescence of a detector molecule. Thus, it is apparent that both light absorption and fluorescence can be used to detect the presence and concentration of certain analytes. As used herein, the term ""light interaction"" refers to light absorption, fluorescence, phosphorescence, luminescence, and the like, as long as a sensor is in the sensor array12in the presence of the unknown fluid sample is irradiated with a light, and a detector can be used to detect light changes in the sensor. For the purpose of illustration, an example of luminescence will be described in detail. It should be understood that it is also possible to detect other types of light interaction to determine the presence and concentration of analytes in view of the present disclosure. In In one aspect, the present invention provides a new method for measuring one or more analytes in a sample using an array of two or more sensors ready. The sensors yourself can respond individually to more than one analyte. The individual Sensors in the sensor array can be designed in accordance with this invention be that by using multiple sensors and math Process their output the concentration of one or more Analytes can be determined exactly. 2illustrates an embodiment of a sensor assembly (eg, a sensor array) of the present invention. The sensor array20includes an array of optical sensors22(the sensors22A.22B.22C.22D.22E.22F.22G.22H.22I.22Jinclude) on a support substrate24are arranged. It should be noted that it is not necessary to arrange the sensors in a manner of precisely aligned rows and columns. Each sensor (22A-22J) includes a sensor matrix that encloses chemicals that contribute to the light interaction in the presence of a suitable analyte when light from the light source14impinging on them. In the sensor arrangement (array in2) includes a suitable number of sensors to provide appropriate signals for all analytes of interest. There some of the sensors that target certain analytes may not Completely independently of the effect of other analytes on the sensors can, if this is desirable is to target more than one sensor to a particular analyte. sensors which target the same analyte, the concentration or the presence of the analyte by different mechanisms of chemical Capture interaction, such that the effect of other analytes on these sensors, which target the same analyte, different is. There is at least one sensor that has a specific one of interest Targeting analytes. The sensors that target the same analyte can to be considered as a group. It is obvious that in some make a group that targets a specific analyte, only includes a sensor. The invention also teaches a method of designing the individual sensors in such a manner that the sensors are interrogated using a single optical source detector combination  can be. Thus, the invention enables one or more analytes to be measured using two or more sensors that are not completely specific (ie, not free from interference from other analytes) with respect to the analytes of interest.4shows the preferred embodiment of the light source and detector assembly device (""device"") of this invention40includes an array42of light source and detector clusters44each of which is a light source46and detectors48that covers itself on a body49located. Preferably, each light source is46physically arranged such that the light source46emerging light at least partially to the corresponding optical sensor22Aetc. in the arrangement of sensors22is delivered. Optical characteristics (wavelength range and intensity) of this light are at least partially adjusted to determine the absorption spectrum of the fluorescent elements in the light4to overlap. The detectors of the clusters are physically arranged such that at least a portion of the fluorescence radiation coming from each of the sensors22A.22Betc. in the sensor arrangement22leaks to one or more of the detectors46of the cluster44corresponding to the specific sensor impinges. Thus, if the arrangement40with the sensor array20coupled, each cluster44a particular sensor22A.22Betc. in the sensor array20facing. It should be noted that certain optical elements, such. As lenses and diffraction gratings, the effectiveness and expediency of conducting the radiation to and from the sensor and the source detector elements can be used. The light sources of4For example, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), laser diodes, light emitting diodes, incandescent sources, combinations thereof, or any other light radiating means may be used. The detectors may be solid state diodes, charge coupled devices, CMOS detectors, any combination thereof or similar detection devices. One or more VCSELs and a number of detector diodes may form a cluster provided for interrogating a specific sensor. In such a cluster, the VCSELs may be surrounded by a number of detectors. Alternatively, rather than an array of clusters, a single such cluster may be used to interrogate all sensors using imaging optics, time division multiplexing, physically moving the cluster to sequentially poll the sensors in the sensor array. The sources and detectors of the array may be controlled by an electronic module that drives the sources and processes the output of the detectors to generate information about the concentration and / or the presence of the analytes of interest. If the sensors are made such that the same excitation light can be used to excite the fluorophore in the sensors, a single light source can be used to generate light and the light can be applied to the various sensors, e.g. B. by a bundle of optical fibers are transmitted. In this scheme, a single light source of a particular wavelength can be used to detect the concentrations or presence of a variety of analytes. In view of the present disclosure, the choice of optical elements (including light sources and detectors) would be obvious to those skilled in the optical design art. 5FIG. 4 is an illustrative example of a sectional view of an embodiment of an array of sensors similar to that of FIG1can be produced shown. In5includes the titer plate50a carrier substrate52, the sensors54A.54B.54Cetc., each membranes56A.56B.56Cetc., carries. A liquid with analytes of interest can be so on the titer plate50be placed that the analytes through the membranes56A.56B.56Cetc. and through the appropriate chemical composition in the sensors54A.54B.54Cetc., ie in the sensor matrices58A.58B.58Cetc. of the sensors can be detected. The titer plate50can with one of the arrangement40similar light source / detector arrangement60be coupled such that each light source detector cluster with the sensors in the sensor array40is coupled and facing the same. The titer plate50can be made such that its size is sufficiently small so that a drop of liquid of interest can enter the sensor arrays of the sensors to be analyzed. The liquid, for. As blood, can be drawn by a capillary action or absorption by the respective membranes in the sensor matrices. For example, if there are N analytes, the concentration and presence of the N analytes can be determined by M sensors SENSOR1, SENSOR2, SENSOR3, SENSOR4, ..., SENSORM(where N ≤ M), each of which is in the same a chemical for specifically interacting with a different analyte. As used herein, the terms ""chemically interact"" and ""chemical interaction"", when referring to the relationship of an analyte-specific chemical to an analyte targeted by the chemical, refer to either a chemical reaction, such as a chemical reaction. As caused by the formation or separation of ionic or covalent bonds, or the physical changes that act at the individual molecular level, such as those shown in FIG. The extent of ionization of a compound or the solubility of a compound. It should be noted that instead of using an optical query involving light sources and detectors, the chemical interaction in the  Sensors in the presence of a liquid to be analyzed by electrical means, such. By using a pH electrode, an oxygen electrode, a temperature probe, etc., and the signal of such electrodes can be transmitted by electricity to a processor for recording, display, further data processing, and the like. An exemplary embodiment of an apparatus for determining the concentration or the presence of analytes has a schematic diagram as shown in FIG6is shown on. The device60includes an array of sensors62using an array of detectors64connected is. Signals from the array of detectors64are sent to a processor for analysis66transfer. The processor66may be any computing device known to those skilled in the art, such as e.g. Electronic computers (e.g., personal computers), a microprocessor, minicomputers, large-scale computers, and the like. The processor66can also control the irradiation of the sensors by the light source. Of the Draft each sensor and the number of sensors in the device are required by the analytes to be measured, the total number of analytes to be measured and the number of interfering components certainly. The interfering components are defined as parameters, which, if changed will cause the measurement of an analyte of interest being affected. The interfering components could be chemical Species, pressure, temperature, volume, etc. of the sample. Thus, the Number of components that interfere significantly larger than the number of species to be measured (the number of analytes). Although some species of analytes may not match the measurement It is possible for some other species to interfere one or more species with the measurement of some other analytes interfere.  In one implementation of the principles set forth above, each of the sensor arrays includes one or more of the following elements: 1) a main matrix component, such as a master matrix component; A hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymer with or without one or more modifiers. A modifier may be a plasticizer, a buffer solution, a filler, or any such species that enhances the functionality of the sensing elements. For example, a plasticizer may be included in a polymer matrix to enhance mobility of the analyte or a complex thereof into or within the matrix, and a filler may be included to modify the physical property such that the matrix is the desired one having physical strength and dimensional stability. Buffers may be added to control the pH. 2) A recognition element that alters its chemical state or conformational state with high specificity in response to the analyte of interest. Such a recognition element may be an analyte-specific chemical that has a more specific chemical recognition interaction with an analyte of interest than with other analytes suspected of being contained in an unknown sample to be analyzed. The recognition element will be described in more detail below. An example of such an analyte-specific chemical is an ionophore, such as an ionophore. B. valinomycin to which a potassium ion, K+, can bind. 3) A chemical element that changes its chemical state depending on the number of recognition events, the altered state itself being an optically absorbing species. An illustrative example of such a chemical element is a dye or a chemical indicator, such as. B. Bromothymolblau, which changes its color with the pH. 4) A chemical element which fluoresces in proportion to the amount of excitation radiation supplied thereto, the frequency characteristics of the emitted fluorescence radiation being at least partially matched to the optical absorption characteristics of the altered state of the element in 3). The The matrix described above under 1) also serves to the elements under 3) and 4) together in a chemical environment, which optimizes the interaction between them, thus causing the signal-to-noise behavior of the sensor elements is maximized. When designing a detector to detect multiple analytes, many sensors must be implemented together in a single detector. Since the behavior of some of the sensors by more than one parameter, such. B. pH, oxygen concentration, the concentration of other ions such. Potassium, calcium, and the like, a plurality of sensors, each differing from other sensors by having a difference in one of the four elements, may be used. Table 1 shows examples of typical components of elements 1 to 4 which may be included in the sensor matrix of the preferred embodiment of this invention. When designing a sensor, at least one component must be selected from each of the columns. These elements can be combined in various ways to produce different sensors of the array. Each of the sensors formed in this manner responds to (ie, targets) a main analyte and may have interference from one or more of the other sample parameters. The selection of elements to be included in a sensor is made such that the sensor based on a given composition has a response that is preferably not proportional to a response of any other sensor to a particular environmental parameter change, e.g. B. is a change in the oxygen concentration is. In other words, the response of the sensor to a particular environmental change has a component that is preferably orthogonal to the response of other sensors (having other combinations of elements in the sensor array) to the same environmental change. Thus, a sufficiently large number of these combinations can be selected to produce an assembly that allows complete and accurate analysis of the desired analytes in the sample. Of course, redundant  Sensors that respond to an environmental change in a manner that is proportional to the response of another sensor may be used. However, the following description includes using the minimum number of sensors to detect a fixed number of relevant parameters. The number of sensors that must be present in the detector to detect a desired number of parameters depends, among other factors, on the parameters and the method of measuring them. If a sensor for determining the concentration of an analyte uses a mechanism that is completely independent of the influence of other analytes, only one such sensor is sufficient to measure the analyte, regardless of how many other sensors are needed, the concentration of the others To measure analytes. Assuming that such an independent sensor generates a signal S for a concentration, C, of the analyte to which the sensor responds in a specific way, the relationship can be mathematically represented as follows:S = f (C) Eq.1where f is a function that relates the signal S to the concentration of the analyte. In front a use of such a sensor for analyzing a Probe the sensor is calibrated to determine the function f. This is usually done experimentally, after which by adjusting the experimental data from the sensor in response to a Series of samples with varying concentrations of the analyte produced Signals S and the corresponding analyte concentrations a mathematical Expression for f is developed. The mathematical expression could be purely empirical or on a certain theoretical functionality analysis of the sensor behavior based. The choice of specific methods for calibration the sensors can be used is widely known in the literature. Are such completely specific Sensors for each of the analytes available in a sample, then the number of Sensors that are required to complete a sample analyze, equal to the number of analytes in the sample. A calibration would be a uncomplicated task of determining the function f for each the sensors. In that case, would for one Sample containing n analytes, n such sensors needed and the signal from each sensor could coincide with its specific function f, determined by calibration, used to determine the concentration of the corresponding analyte. The presence of others Analyte would have no impact on the analysis. However, if the signal Si ofthe i-th sensor in the array is also equal to the concentration of other (interfering) analytes 1, 2, 3, 4, ... m, where m <or = n (ie less than or equal to n ), the equation is as follows:Si= F (Ci, C1, C2,..., Cm) Eq.where F is the function that relates the signal generated by the sensor in response to the concentrations of analytes of interest and interfering materials. Equation 2 represents the most general case in which the total number of analytes contributing to the signal from the sensor is m. The present invention teaches methods of designing sensors such that each sensor in the array is primarily responsive to an analyte and has relatively low responsiveness to a limited number of other analytes termed interferents (the interfering analytes). Thus, m is usually a small number <10. It should be noted that although Ci isreferred to as the concentration of the i-th analyte, it could also be a parameter other than that of the concentration. For example, the temperaturedeviation couldcontribute to the overall signal Si. Effects of other parameters such. Pressure, humidity, etc., could also be detected in a similar manner. Such a sensor generates the total signal Si, which depends on the concentrations of several analytes including the interfering analytes and other variables such. B. the temperature is dependent. Therefore, such a sensor can not be used alone to analyze the concentration of an analyte in a sample having other interfering analytes. Such an array of multi-interference sensors can be used to determine the concentrations of one or more analytes in a sample. To calibrate such an array, a number of calibration solutions must be used. In the most general case, the response of the sensors is not linear or bilinear, so Gl.2 can not be linearized. To produce  According to the function in Equation 2, neural network techniques can be used using the required number of calibration samples. Such methods are known in the literature. The The present invention further teaches a method of linearizing the response of the sensors such that equation 2 simplifies can be. About that In addition, this invention also teaches a method of making Sensors with only a few interferents, so the mathematical Formulations that hold the sensor response to the analyte and Interference Concentrations, Simplified and simple matrix manipulations can be used to to generate a model that can be used to determine the analyte concentrations to determine. For example becomes a on a fluorescence quenching ruthenium tris diphenyl phenanthroline based oxygen sensor usually not by the presence of ions and others Influenced gases. Thus, only one sensor needs to be specific an oxygen concentration targeted, be present. However, one can Glucose concentration and a concentration of metabolites such as z. B. lactate can be measured by sensors, which also by a Oxygen concentration or pH changes are influenced. It can also sensors using ionophores, indicator dyes and fluorophores are prepared as described below is. Such internal sensors can be influenced by pH. Thus it is with knowledge of the specific analytes of interest and by selecting the appropriate ionophores, Indicators and fluorophores in a sensor possible too determine which parameters may affect sensor behavior, d. H. which analytes may be appear as interferers. Gl.2 can be so well defined for the specific Samples are simplified. Such a designed array can under Using the simplified form of Eq.2 and a suitable one Modeling method such. For example, neural networks are easily calibrated become. Another simplification of the model will be based later to the ones discussed below Sensor functions taught. pH Sensors Optical pH sensors can be based on light absorbance or fluorescence changes of a weakly dissociating dye in response to changes in pH. A weakly dissociating dye HA (in acid form) in solution is in accordance with the equationHA <=> A-+ H+Eq.S1in equilibrium with its base form A-. If square brackets indicate the concentration of a substance, where [A-] is the concentration of A-, [H+] is the concentration of H+, and [HA] is the concentration of HA, the equilibrium constant Ka for this reaction is:Ka = [A-] [H+] / [HA] Eq.S2. Since pH = -log [H+] and pKa = -log Ka,pH = pKa - log [HA] / [A-] Eq.S3. For a sensor in which a fixed amount of the dye is C, which may be the case when the dye is immobilized in a matrix, C remains constant in the absence of bleach or other dye lossesC = [HA] + [A-] Eq.S4. This leads to the following:pH = pKa + log (C / [HA] - 1} Eq.S5. Thus, the pH can be measured by measuring the concentration of both forms of the dye, ie, [HA] or [A-]. For some pH-sensitive dyes, such as. Phenol red, the acid form and the base form absorb radiation in different spectral regions. Thus, for phenol red, the acid form has one  Absorption peak at about 430 nm and the base form an absorption peak at about 550 nm. According to the Beer-Lambert law:Absorbance [A-] = ε L [A-] = log Io / I Eq.S6,where ε is the molar extinction coefficient of A-, L is the length of the path traveled by the light, and Io and I are the intensities of the transmitted light in the absence of A-. Combining Gl.S5 and Gl.S6 results in the following:pH = pKa - log {CεL / log (Io / I) - 1} Eq.S7. Gl.S7 gives an S-shaped Curve showing the pH to the ratio of intensities (Io / I) relates. For fluorescent dyes such. For example, HPTS (8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrene trisulfonic acid) releases the energy absorbed by HA and A-(at wavelengths of about 405 nm and about 470 nm, respectively) as fluorescence at about 520 nm. The relationship between a fluorescence intensity, IF, emitted by a sample containing a fluorophore concentration C with an extinction coefficient ε and a fluorescence quantum yield Φ (the ratio of the number of emitted photons to the number of absorbed photons)IF= Io Φη {1-exp (-ε LC)} Eq.where η is the optical collection efficiency of the instrument. At low absorbance, the equation can be simplified to read as follows:IF= 2.3 Io Φ η ε LC Eq.S9. For a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye excited on the absorption peak of the base form, the fluorescence intensity, IFA, is related to pH by:pH = pKa - log {constant / IFA- l} Eq.S10. A Equation for the acid form of the dye may be similar Be deduced way. PCO2sensors Partial pressure of carbon dioxide, PCO2, is typically measured using the Severinghaus principle, as shown below. CO2dissolved in water dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).CO2+ H2O <=> H2CO3<=> H++ HCO3-Eq.S11. In equilibrium is the dissolved concentration of CO2in an aqueous sample such. B. blood proportional to the partial pressure of CO2. The equilibrium constant (dissociation constant) for CO2in water isKCO2= {[H+] [HCO3-]} / {[CO2] [H2O]} Eq. If the medium in which the measurement is made is an aqueous solution of NaHCO3which dissociates completely into Na+and HCO3-ions, the total concentrations of HCO3-and H2O in the medium remain relatively constant and shows that Gl.S12 tooPCO2= constant A [H+] or pH = constant B + log PCO2Eq.S13leads. The above equation indicates that CO2dissolved in a sample can be measured by measuring the pH of a bicarbonate solution in equilibrium with the sample. To avoid changes in the pH of the sample affecting CO2measurements, the sensor with the bicarbonate solution and a pH-sensitive dye can be optically detected by a membrane that only allows CO2to equilibrate with the buffer solution , encapsulated or deposited. Such a membrane serves as a barrier to the hydrogen ions in the test sample. PO2sensors Hydrogen is an excellent quencher of the fluorescence of many fluorophores. Optical methods for detecting oxygen can be based on fluorescence quenching of an excited state of a dye molecule (fluorophore molecule). The excitation of a fluorophore F and its quenching by an oxygen molecule are represented by the following equations:F + hνex→ F * Eq.S14,where h represents the Planck constant, νexthe excitation frequency of the radiation and * the excited state of a substance. For the brilliant decay appliesF * → F + hνemEq.S15,where νem isthe frequency of the radiation emitted at the decay of F *. For non-radiative decay appliesF * → F + ΔH Eq.S16,where ΔH is the enthalpy change. When the fluorescence is quenched by collision with oxygen molecules, it resultsF * + ½ O2→ F + O * Eq.S17andO * → ½ O2+ ΔH Eq.S18. Consequently The amount of oxygen present can be measured by measuring the oxygen quenching excited form of the fluorophore can be determined. The decay rate of an excited fluorophore F * after instantaneous excitation isd / dt [F *]o= - (γ + κ) [F *]oEq.S19,where γ and κ are rate constants for a radiating and non-radiative decay (ie without a quencher). Continuous illumination produces a permanent occupancy of the excited fluorophores, ie F *. In the absence of an eraser (represented by a suffix ""o"")d / dt [F *]o= f (t) - (γ + κ) [F *]o= 0 Eq.S20,where f (t) is the constant-excitation function. If an extinguisher is present, the equation is as followsd / dt [F *] = f (t) - {(γ + κ) + kq[Q]} [F *] = 0 Eq.S21,qwhere k is the rate constant of by Gl.S17 (extinction rate) reaction illustrated and [Q] is the quencher concentration O2.Excluding f (t) and writing (γ + κ) as 1 / τo, where τo isthe lifetime of the fluorophore in the absence of a quencher, follows:[F *]o/ [F *] = 1 + kqτo[Q] Eq.S22. Assuming that the rate of non-radiative decay does not change in the presence of a quencher and the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of radiating fluorophores  the equation is as follows:IFo/ IF= 1 + KSV[4] Eq.S23,where KSV isequal to kqτoand is known as the Stern-Volmer constant, and Eq. S22 and Eq.S23 are variations of the Stern-Volmer equation. Thus, by measuring the intensity of the fluorescence emission by a continuously excited fluorophore, the concentration of the quencher such as. For example, oxygen can be measured using the Stern-Volmer equation. For lifetime measurements, the fluorophore can be excited by a delta function and the rate of fluorescence decay observed. According to Eq.S20, the lifetime of fluorescence decay in the absence of fluorophoreτo= 1 / (γ + κ) Eq.S24. In the presence of an extinguisher is the lifeτ = 1 / (1 / τo+ kq[Q]) Eq.S25andτo/ τ = 1 + KSV[Q] Eq.S26,what is the life-form of the Stern-Volmer equation and can be used to determine an oxygen concentration using lifetime measurements. electrolyte sensors Cations such. For example, Na+, K+, Ca++and Mg++can be optically measured according to very similar guidelines. In general, an ion selective ionophore is selected. Such ionophores are lipophilic inclusion compounds, which usually have a ring structure. In such a compound, the ring contains several slightly electronegative atoms such. B. oxygen. The size of the ring and the total number of oxygen atoms determine the relative preference (selectivity) of the ionophore for cations of different sizes and charged states. Another ionophore class undergoes conformational changes following selective cation binding. Thus, a double ring ethers-based ionophore, referred to as BME-44, forms a double-shelled inclusion for a captured potassium ion. BME-44 has two ring ethers connected by a three carbon chain. Is a potassium ion present. If a potassium ion is present, the two crown ethers fold over to form the double shell. However, the present invention is also applicable regardless of the scientific theory regarding ionophores. These Ionophores are lipophilic and are in a hydrophobic polymer such as As polyvinyl chloride (PVC) together with a large amount a plasticizer masked. The ionophores extract the selective Ion from the watery Solution, which is in contact with the polymer surface. Since the ion in the ionophore in a more favorable Energy environment is as in the aqueous environment, it occurs readily in the hydrophobic phase of the polymer. However, this causes charge inequality in the polymer phase and on the surface of the polymer. The excess of charge built up in the polymer can be used to form another, less desirable cation, such as a cation. B. H+ tosplit off from the polymer phase. Alternatively, a charged bilayer is formed on the surface of the polymer. The number of cleaved cations or the potential gradient on the surface is proportional to the concentration of the cation in the aqueous solution. Similar ionophores are also for some anions such. For example, chloride ions available. Extraction of an anion into the polymer phase causes a further anion to split off or a cation such. For example, a hydrogen ion accompanies the anion into the polymer phase. The build-up of potential on the surface of the polymer can be measured optically using potential-sensitive dyes. The fluorescence of some dyes, such as. B. rhodamine B, depends strongly on the electrical charge in their environment. Thus, a measurement of the fluorescence changes of a polymer film in which such a dye together with an ionophore immo  used to measure the concentration of the selective ion in a sample. As mentioned above, may be an extraction of a positive ion into a hydrophobic polymer be by an ionophore so that another cation such. B. a Hydrogen ion is split off. Thus, if a pH sensitive loses Dye such. B. HPTS of phenol red or bromothymol blue in the Polymer is arranged, the dye is a hydrogen ion, if one Cation is extracted by the ionophore from the sample. Consequently changed the optical absorption or fluorescence emission of the dye as with the pH sensors described above. A reversal This effect can be used to control the concentration of anions to determine. The Folding of BME-44 in the presence of a potassium ion can be used to a fluorophore such. Rhodamine and a quencher like z. B. Fluorescein closer bring together. In this configuration, the Foerster energy transfer from the fluorophore to the quencher the fluorescence change in relation to to the number of extracted potassium ions. Becomes an electron donor placed between a fluorophore and an ionophore (for cations) the ability of the donor, to transfer an electron to the excited fluorophores, blocked when a cation is in the ionophore. Thus is the fluorescence process non-radiating when no cation in the Ionophore is present. If a cation is trapped by the ionophore, becomes the electron transfer blocked on the fluorophores and the fluorescence energy is radiant issued. Metabolitsensoren metabolites such as For example, glucose, lactate and creatinine are used enzymatic conversion of these species (substrates) into another Molecule, such as As hydrogen peroxide, measured. Alternatively, the enzymatic Transformation of the substrate from a consumption of another species such as B. accompanied by oxygen. Thus, a sensor measurement of Concentration of any of these generated or consumed species used to determine the concentration of the substrate. Glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide by the consumption of oxygen by glucose oxidase (GOD) according to the following equation:Glucose + GOD + O2-> gluconic acid + H2O2Gl.S27 Catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase and mediated by NAD-producing hydrogen ions, lactate is converted to pyruvate:Lactate + NAD -> pyruvate + NADH + H+Eq.S28 Creatinine can be measured using a multi-enzyme experiment in which the following reactions occur:Creatinine + H2O -> creatine (enzyme: creatinine amidohydrolase) Gl.S29Creatine -> sarcosine + urea (enzyme: creatine amidinohydrolase) Gl.S30Sarcosine + H2O + O2-> glycine + HCHO + H2O2(enzyme: sarcosine oxidase) Gl.S31 Equations S27 through S31 indicate that glucose and creatinine can be measured using the oxygen sensing methods discussed above. However, the oxygen tension in a sample, such as blood, can vary considerably. It is therefore preferred to make this reaction oxygen independent. In glucose detection, this is achieved by using a mediator such. B. Cyanoferrat (III), which replaces the oxygen, achieved. For measuring lactate, a pH sensor can be used. Here a change in the pH of the sample also affects the lactate measurements. In these situations, it is necessary to measure the PO2and pH of the sample and correct for the interference. Based on the above, sensor matrices can be produced using combinations of matrix material, analyte-specific chemicals, indicator dyes, and fluorophores  be put. Table 1 shows a list of illustrative examples of these materials that can be selected.

The analyte-specific element can be selected to be specific target analytes of interest and, if he so wishes, to minimize the influence of other analytes on the sensor. To the Example would be to detect pH in the physiological range a pH sensitive Dye such. B. bromothymol blue suitable. However, to capture the pH change due to glucose oxidation by glucose oxidase in a glucose sensor preferably another dye having a pK value, the to a pK value of this oxidation reaction is selected. Furthermore should, as mentioned above, the wavelength range for optical Absorption of this dye the fluorescence emission wavelength of Overlap fluorophore from element (4). Such a dye (indicator element) can be obtained from those shown in Table 1 listed. information about the pK values and Areas of optical absorption of various pH-sensitive indicators are in the Literator readily available (eg Sigma-Aldrich Handbook of Stains, Dyes and Indicators, ISBN number 0-041633-22-5). The experts in the field of optical indicators It is also known how some dyes are chemically modified can, around the pK value and / or the wavelength range for optical Adapt absorption. Such modifications can be made to meet the requirements of this invention. The Fluorophores can selected to be in an excitation wavelength range of interest and a fluorescence wavelength range of interest. To the Example can a series of those listed in the fourth column of Table 1 Fluorophores are excited by a common optical source. About that In addition, these fluorophores are also characterized by a long (0.5-4 milliseconds) Fluorescence decay life, each in one area short enough to use only one optoelectronic Configuration can be measured. Other fluorophores this Literature types can instead, they are often used (eg, Atlas of Fluorescence Spectra and Lifetimes of Dyes attached to Protein, Analytical Letters, 18 (A4), 393-421 (1985)). About that it is for Professionals in the field obviously that other dyes can be modified to adjust the excitation, the emission wavelengths and the lifetime, to meet the requirements of this invention. It is considered such modified dyes are useful in the practice of this invention be used. In the production of sensors, as mentioned above, many analytes of interest such. In a physiological fluid (eg, blood, saliva, urine, etc.) via changes in pH and oxygen measurement. Buffering methods and enzyme conversion, ionophores and combinations of weak acids (for electrolyte measurement) can be used. This allows the query efficiency of the sensors. Thus, at least a portion (eg, at least one-third, or at least half or all) of the sensors preferably utilizes the measurement of the O2concentration (or the pre  or the pH measurement to derive the concentration or presence of the analyte of interest. Table 2 shows an illustrative list of analytes of interest and the changes that can be used to determine the concentration of the analytes.

The disclosure of dyes, fluorophores, the chemical composition of fluorescence / absorbance, and the Sensor construction is at Wolfbeis u. a. described. Such Matrix includes PVC (polyvinyl chloride) with a plasticizer, ionophore of valinomycin, a chemical indicator of bromothymol blue, and a fluorophore of ruthenium tris (dipyridyl) perchlorate, d. H. Ru (Didipy). 3Figure 4 is an absorbance and luminescence graph of the elements in such a system (as described by Wolfbeis et al. above) showing how it can be used to detect the presence and amount of potassium ions. In3is a curve V1, the absorbance of a reactive indicator dye N-9 under alkaline conditions of about pH 9 (ie, in an alkaline solution). A curve V2 is the absorbance of dye N-9 under acidic conditions of about pH 4. These two curves show that the absorbance peak moves with the changing of the pH along the frequency axis (in other words, the wavelength axis). A curve V3 is the absorbance of the fluorophore Ru complex (ie Ru (Didipy)). A curve V4 is the fluorescence emission of the Ru complex. According to the present invention, by exploiting the fact that pH changes the absorbance wavelength of the indicator dye, the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore in a solution can be used to detect the pH change. If z. For example, when the fluorophore is excited by a light of about 470 nm, the fluorophore emits fluorescence in a region peaking at about 630 nm. This fluorescent peak overlaps with the absorbance peak of N-9 at pH 9. Thus, a portion of the fluorescent light is absorbed by the dye. When K+ is taken upby the ionophore valinomycin, the charge balance requires that the weak acid (valinomycin) cleave an H+resulting in a decrease in pH. As the pH drops, the absorbance peak of dye N-9 moves toward shorter wavelengths and therefore absorbs less of the fluorescence of the Ru complex. Further, the N-9 absorbance peak may approach close enough to the absorbance peak of the fluorophore Ru complex to compete with the fluorophore for the excitation light from a light source, further reducing the fluorescence of the Ru complex. Thus, the fluorescence emission of the Ru complex can be detected to indicate the pH change in the solution. Several different indicators can be used in different sensors to detect the same analyte. Obviously, different indicator dyes have different absorbance characteristics, and different fluorophores have different excitation and fluorescence characteristics. By judicious selection of indicator dyes and fluorophores, different sensors can be made to provide different fluorescence emissions in the same pH range or in different pH ranges. As mentioned above, an analyte can be analyzed using two or more different chemistry methods. For example, a glucose sensor may be based on the enzymatic action of glucose oxidase to convert glucose to gluconic acid, which is a weak acid and would result in a change in pH. Moreover, conversion of glucose to gluconic acid consumes O2and the changes in oxygen content in a sample can be measured to derive the concentration of glucose in the sample. Another example is urea, which can be converted to CO2and NH3by the enzymatic action of urease. CO2dissolves in a bicarbonate solution and changes its pH, which can be measured by a pH sensor. The formed NH3is consumed by nitrification bacteria that consume O2. Thus, the urea concentration can be determined by a sensor with nitrification bacteria and a pH detection capability. Different matrices (eg, membranes) may be used for different gases to provide different solubilities of the gases in the matrices. To detect ions via pH measurement by the method of using an ion-specific ionophore and an indicator dye, sensors can be made using several different pH-sensitive indicator dyes. These indicator dyes are selected to have different pK values and thus a different sensitivity to pH changes. Based on Table 1, by selecting ionophores, schemes similar to the previous one for detecting K+can be used to detect other ions. The present invention provides a scheme in which an indicator dye that is sensitive to PO2is made to be pH responsive, and vice versa. As described above, the fluorescence intensity of certain fluorescent dyes (eg Ru (Didipy) which fluoresces at a peak at about 620 nm) varies depending on the concentration of the quencher (here oxygen) according to the Stern-Volmer equation:IFo/ IF= I + KSV[Q] Eq.S23. Also, the time constant of a dye, as z. B. also Ru (Didipy) depends on the concentration of the extinguisher:τ = 1 / (1 / τo+ kq[Q]) Eq.S25. Several Ruthenium dyes have these characteristics, e.g. Ru (II) tris (4,4'-diphenyl-2,2'-bipyridyl) chloride and Ru (II) tris-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline perchlorate. These Ruthenium complexes and other complexes of transition metals are advantageously because they have long time constants (eg of the order of magnitude of a few milliseconds) they are particularly suitable for measuring changes as a result of deletion do. By their excitation wavelengths such dyes are also suitable for use in conjunction with commercial Laser diode light sources and photodiode detectors. As it is in3As shown, the fluorescence curve of the Ru dye and the absorbance peak of Bromothyne blue (BTB) have a substantial overlap. In addition, the absorbance of BTB (ABTB) depends on pH, according topH = pKa - log {constant / ABTB- l} Eq.S32,where Ka is the dissociation constant of BTB. BTB has an absorption peak that overlaps with the fluorescent peak of Ru dyes. The resulting change in fluorescence emission and the concomitant change in fluorescence lifetime depend on pH. Equations Gl.S23 and Gl.S32 can be combined, and Gl.S25 can be combined with Gl.S32 via the fluorescence-absorbance overlap region to obtain a relationship between pH and oxygen concentration. Several pH-sensitive dyes have an absorbance peak that overlaps the fluorescent peak of ruthenium complexes. The following Table 3 is a listing of some examples:  Table 3 Absorbance of pH-sensitive dyesdyeAbsorbance, nm region / maximumpH rangesAlizaria or Mordant Red 11500-650 / 567, 6105.5-6.8; 10.1 to 12.1Alizarin Red S, Mordant Red 3490-640 / 556, 5963.7 to 5.2Alkaline Blue 6B500-700 / 6039.4 to 14.0brilliant Green550-700 / 6250-2.6chlorophenol450-620 / 5724.8 to 6.4malachite Green50-670 / 6140-2.0; 11.6 to 14.0methyl Purple550-67- / 6204.8-5.4α-naphtholphthalein500-72-7.3-8.7Nitrazingelb450-700 / 5866 to 7.2resazurin500-650 / 5983.8 to 6.5Tetrabromophenolblau500-670 / 6103.0 to 4.6thymol480-670 / 5961.2-2.8; 8.0 to 9.2Thymonaphthelein500-689 / 5928.8 to 10.5bromothymol blue500-700 / 6156.0 to 7.6 Although not all of the dyes have high pH sensitivity over the range over which the pH of the sample changes, they can be used to advantage if the matrix in which the dye can be effective has little interference from other analytes. For example, a hydrophobic membrane prevents ions from passing through it. Table 4 shows a table of examples of a polymer substance having different oxygen solubility.

The resulting film can be used as a pH sensor. This film can also be excited at a wavelength of 400-500 nm, and the excitation can be measured at a wavelength of about 640 nm. Again, the fluorescence intensity of this film is pH dependent.

The sensor will go through Spread this solution and a casting made of films. The sensor can be at a wavelength of about 470 nm are excited, and the emission can be at a wavelength of be measured about 610 nm. In order to measure a plurality of analytes simultaneously, this invention takes advantage of the fact that the degree of interference is different for different sensors, depending on the chemical composition selected for the sensor. Each of the sensors has varying amounts of interference from the analyte species in the sample. Thus, using a large number of sensors and using correlation techniques, the composition of the sample relative to the species of analyte can be determined. Such correlation methods have been used in other fields of research and we have recognized that they adopt analyte analysis in the present invention  can be. The foregoing description has shown that the analytes of interest can all be measured using either a pH sensor or an oxygen sensor or both. The Stern-Volmer equations (S23 and S26) show that the sensor signal τ or IF islinearly dependent on the concentration of the extinguisher [Q]. In the case of the oxygen sensor, the quencher is the analyte. In the case of the pH sensor and other sensors measuring an analyte concentration based on titration of a pH-sensitive indicator (the second element), the sensor signal is a characteristic S-shaped titration curve (see8th, Wolfbeis et al., Above). The sensitivity of these sensors is greatest when the measured sensor signal (τ or IF) is on the quasi-linear central portion of the indicator titration curve. One method of achieving this is to incorporate a weak acid or base (an example is sodium bicarbonate) into the sensor membrane (element (1)) to adjust the pH of the sensor in the linear region. Such a component of the element (1) effectively shifts the titration curve to allow the sensor to be effective in the linear region for the selected indicator. In the sensor arrays of this invention, a number of sensors may be used that differ only in the pK value of the indicator or (including) the type and concentration of the acid / base component that shifts the titration curve. This ensures that for a given dynamic range of analyte concentrations, a number of sensors are effective in the linear response range. Therefore, only the linear sensors can be selected from an array to perform the calibration and detection mathematical operations. One another method well known in the art of analysis is known as the ""standard addition method."" In this The method will be an appropriate amount of the analytes of interest added to the concentrations of the analytes in the linear To move area. Thus could varying amounts of the analytes in the sensor arrays of this invention be incorporated into element (1) so that the area over which the analyte concentration distributes when a sample is mixed is, is linear. Thus, the methods of this invention can be used to linearize the response of the sensors. Therefore, calibration and modeling of the sensor arrays can be represented by a linear matrix equation:S = MC Eq. 3,where S is a column vector representing the signals obtained from the n sensors in the array. M is an n × m matrix representing the parameters that correlate the sensor signals with the concentrations of the analytes (including interferents). Finally, C is an m × 1 matrix containing the concentrations of the analytes in the sample. In Matrix M have only the columns that the interfering Analytes correspond to non-zero values. Thus, if only the pH and oxygen concentrations produce a response from the sensors, only two columns of the matrix M have nonzero values. When a size Number of analytes in a large number of sensors one Interference, the matrix is more complex. In any case, such an equation by chemometric methods such. B. PLS be solved. In PLS, the unknown concentration, Cun, of an analyte can be determined from the signal, Sun, which is obtained from the sample by using the following equation:Cun= GSandEq. 4,where G is estimated from the columns of a matrix R of sensor signals in response to a series of calibration samples of concentrations C. The matrix G is then estimated by:G = CR+Eq.5,where R+ isthe pseudoinverse of R. As previously mentioned, the number of analytes to be analyzed may be less than the number of analytes (including interferents) that contribute to the sensor signals. In such cases, it may not be necessary to know the concentrations of the interferents in the calibration samples to produce G. If all concentrations in C are known, a multicomponent analysis can be used to determine the calibration. If only the values of some of the rows of C are known, PLS can be used for calibration. Mathematically, several methods for determining the pseudoinverse of R can be used by those skilled in the art. The most reliable and comprehensive method is based on singular value decomposition (SVD). The application of this method to determine R+and thus G is well known in the literature (eg, Linear Algebra and its Applications, Gilbert Strang, Chapter 9, Academic Press, New York). As soon as G for one comprehensive set of calibration samples, represented by C. is, has been determined, can be used to the unknown To determine the concentration of any analyte in the sample as long as all of the analytes that produce the signal from this sample, also in the calibration set were present. It can be programmed a processor be, according to one Algorithm that implements the previous math too to calculate. The program can be used in a medium such. A hard disk, a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a tape, a Zip disk, and the like or stored in the processor itself.

Neural network systems used to learn sequences to generate scheduling and scheduling systems, or user tasks, take a process as a TSSG (Temporal Sequence Storage and Generation) into the system to generate a set of tasks. TSSG is based on observations of sequence retention by biological systems. There is a particular class of neural networks that is ideally suited for modeling TSSG since it can be trained using inductive learning algorithms. Current neural networks achieving TSSG include time delay networksiwhich implement hooks embedding theorem and various recurrent models such as spin-glassii; Networks with context neuronsiii; theElmannetworkiVand extensions thereofv; and the approach of ""crumbling history""vi. However, the spin glass is limited to the reproduction of short sequences, the Elman network uses an associative chain to generate sequences which is computationally expensive, and the approach of "" fragile history ""can not plan successfully using learned sequences. In all of these cases, the ability of neural networks to successfully integrate into systems that perform complex planning tasks, such as pattern management, is limited.

In the following description, the terms ""layer"", ""node"", ""activity"", ""weighting"", ""inhibiting weighting"", ""stimulating weighting"" and ""weighting initialization"" are used and defined as follows:a ""layer"": a data store, such as an array or a matrix of elements, the elements being the nodes described below;a ""node"": an array element that receives inputs from and delivers outputs to other array elements in the same layer or elements in other layers;""Activity"": values in the array elements that are calculated from input functions of and output functions to connected layers;""Weight"": a multiplier applied to the input and output functions that controls the amount of activity that is input to or output from each node;""Inhibiting weighting"": a multiplier with a value less than 0;""Stimulating weighting"": a multiplier with a value greater than 0;""Weighting initialization"": the sequences generated by the present invention are controlled by the configuration of the layers, the functions between connected layers and the weights The means for generating a sequence of elements comprises a calculation process and the various parameters in the control equations require an appropriate initialization Thus, weighting initialization relates to the initial configuration of the weights.""Task"": a category of work, such as email, report, meeting, etc .;""Subtask"": Components that have a task can be a subtask for a task of the email: open email, read email, reply to email, archive email, etc. General overview of operating layer With reference to1For example, one environment for carrying out the present invention is a general, conventional computer system100on, comprising: a conventional keyboard101; a display screen103like a CRT or plasma screen; a mouse105; a processor107such as a PentiumTMprocessor; a random access memory (RAM)109; a hard disk111; an audio input113like a microphone to capture the utterance of the user; and input / output interfaces115to connect the workstation to a local area network (LAN), wide area networks (WAN) and / or the Internet to facilitate data exchange, including e-mail messaging, with remote users associated with such Networks are connected. the interface115also allows a simple telephone service (POTS) control and the in1shown components are connected to each other via a common bus117connected. In addition to the in1shown single system configuration, multiple computer systems (not shown) via a local network via the input / output interface115be connected to each other. With reference also to2can a device201for generating sequences of elements to be executed by a computer system, generally referred to as a sequence generator, on the hard disk111are stored for processing by the processor107, In the embodiment described here, the sequence generator201part of an IA (intelligent assistant) system219which allows users to dedicate their time to very complex tasks while the system219Some decisions on behalf of the user or user are based on previous observations by the visitor or on stored user preferences. This is done by generating a sequence of items that are tasks that are performed by the IA system219for the user to execute. Typical tasks to be performed by the system include time, information and communication management. If the computer system has multiple computer workstations, multiple IA systems can219be active and communicate with each other. As in2shown, such an IA system219in addition a set of autonomous systems205.207.209.211.213.215.217commonly referred to as agents specialized in various tasks, such as appointment management, telephone call filtering and email prioritization, web search, telephone directory inquiry, multimodal interface, and communication flow management. Each agent has its own interface and interacts with the user in its own particular way, and the agents communicate with each other by sending messages. These agents assign re  active, collaborative, advisory and proactive agents that respond to events in the user's environment (such as email and phone calls) by initiating interactions with the user. The sequence generator201can with the appointment wizard205which can be the tasks of a user for a day, and create a sequence order for the tasks based on the knowledge of the user's preferred work patterns and what tasks the user has recently completed. This information can be considered a user profile203be available and may additionally include information concerning preferences as a function of the time of day and availability of the user with inputs from the agents that own the IA system219turn off. The sequence generator201can if he is in the intelligent assistant (IA) system219is integrated, also and / or alternatively used to organize inter-agent tasks, such that it dynamically directs a preferred order of agent tasks based on learned agent capabilities201, Thus, the elements generated by the sequence generator201ordered sequentially, include work items and subtasks for a range of entities, such as a user, part of a facility, or a business. In the following description, work tasks and subtasks of a user are described as examples of elements having sequences generated by embodiments of the present invention. A sequence generator201In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, infrastructure management provides for tasks to be performed by an entity based on a learned context-based task order. In the context of the present invention, context-based means taking into account the tasks that have been performed before the tasks that make up the current schedule, as well as considering current intermediate task settings. If the tasks are machine-processable events, such as kernel events, or inter-agent transmission of information, the order in which a series of tasks, including, for example, system calls, is to be processed, is likely to depend on which Tasks have been completed previously. If the tasks are user-based, the selection of the tasks to be performed next is similarly likely, at least in part, to be determined by what tasks were previously performed. In this latter scenario, an embodiment of the present invention contemplates, among other things, the context of the user after completing the previous tasks. The sequence generator thus receives as input the previously completed tasks and issues a sequence of tasks in a preferred order that best suits the current context of the user. This output is preferably realized by a neural network system trained on previously observed context-based behavior patterns, as described below. Exemplary embodiment: Sequence generator for generating context-based sequences of elements Overview of the sequence generator201 As in3shown has the sequence generator201for generating context-based sequences of elements two parts, one identifying part303and a neural network part301, The sequence generator201can receive as input tasks that a user has already completed. The identifying part303of the sequence generator201compares these typed tasks with a known set of tasks. Then it gives a value representative of a best match to this known set of tasks (or a default if no best match can be found) to the neural network part301off and the neural network301generates a subsequent task sequence based on the value of ""best match"" it receives. As described below, the identifying part303a classifier, such as an SOM (Self-Organizing Map) system304, have and connecting means305a.305b, which are described below, may be the value that is attached to the SOM system304is output with the neural network part301connect. For example, by using such a system, the user may perform some tasks that the appointment assistant205supervised. The appointment assistant205Gives this set of tasks to the SOM system304which operates by accessing stored sequences of previously-observed tasks to find a best match between the stored sequences of tasks and the received task's input sequence. The SOM system304identifies this best match by means of an output signal and the output signal is sent to the neural network system301transfer. Once the neural network301an input signal from the SOM system304has received the neural network301a sequence of tasks, as described in detail below. As in3is described by the SOM system304a plurality of individual self-organizing imaging units304a.304beach of which has access to (different) stored sequences. The best match between the received sequence and stored sequences is thus identified by one of the self-organizing mapping units304a.304band the above-described output signal is thus a signal coming from the unit which has identified the best match. This output then becomes with each of the task units306connected, what, as in3as a unit304ais shown, about further connections305a.305bhappens. The sequence generator201provides increased functionality over the neural network system301alone, which only reproduces sequences that it has learned in isolation, ie for an input of, for example, 1 gives the neural network system301a pre-learned sequence of numbers. In contrast, the sequence generator replaces201effectively, the ""1"" input with an input representative of what was previously done, such as by an output from the SOM system304intended. Thus, when a user has performed tasks 1 to 3 of a series of tasks to himself a subsequent task sequence from the neural network system301to gain would be the input to the neural network system301logically ""3"" and the system would create a task sequence that it had previously learned for ""3"", for example ""4, 5, 6."" For the sequence generator201however, if the input were ""1, 2, 3"" or possibly ""2, 1, 3"" or it may be an unknown task in the sentence, such as ""1, a, 3"", the SOM system304of the sequence generator201can respond differently to each of these inputs, producing a different ""best match"" for each of the sequences. Again, the neural network system can301generate another subsequent task sequence in response. Thus, the sequence generator has201to generate context-based sequences, a significantly more complex set of available behaviors than a system301that produces sequences isolated. Regarding the IA system219This is a more useful tool - the IA system219concerns (partially) automation processes for a user so that the user can concentrate on higher-level tasks, for example, when the user returns to his office and has already completed tasks A, B, C, what does he want to do next The sequence generator201takes an input from the self-organizing mapping unit304a.304b, which most closely corresponds to the tasks A, B, C, and leads them to the neural network system301to. For comparison, the neural network system301alone would generate an order for subsequent tasks based on a preferred order when performing these tasks in isolation. The passes through the present invention a training phase before acting as a system for outputting context-based Sequences of elements can be used. The following description first discloses an embodiment the configuration of the sequence generator and then disclose the steps involved in the training and operation of the sequence generator are. Description of the neural network system301 Looking at the neural network system301as described in Appendix 1, it is based on a network known as the ACTION NETWORKvii, which serves as a schematic version of the cortical (cortex) and subcortical (basal ganglion, fascia) structures of the frontal lobes in4will be shown. The ACTION network403is a recurrent neural network undergoing supervised learning and having a plurality of layers, that is, in particular, a first layer400athat has two cortical areas, SMA413and PMC415; a second layer400bwhich has the basal ganglion and consists of STR417, STN419and GPe, GPi421.423(both external and internal); and another layer400cTHL425having. Every ACTION network403is operational, one input411to receive and an issue427to create. In3becomes a task unit306shown a number of ACTION networks304which are arranged in a hierarchical relation.5shows a task unit, which is an upper network503and a lower network505which is the simplest possible task unit layout. The edition427afrom the top ACTION network503returns the input411bto the lower ACTION network505and this generates the output427bfrom the task unit306, Thus, the only difference in architecture between the upper and lower ACTION networks is the inclusion of a connection427afrom the top ACTION network503to the lower ACTION network505, As in3There may be a variety of task units, each of which, as in6reproduced, an upper ACTION network601.601bcan have that with a variety of lower ACTION networks603a.603b.603cis connected (to give two task units, each one the  ACTION NETWORKS (a)601.603a.603b.603cand (b)601b.603a.603b.603cexhibit). Because all of the networks601.603are identical in terms of their components, they can each store up to four values (which are tasks or subtasks thereof for this particular embodiment). There is no limit to the number of layers that can be connected to provide output sequences and the system can be categorized for a variety of top and bottom ACTION network connections. As further discussed in Appendix 1 and as in72, two or more task units can be laterally connected by means of a connection713which is a variable weighting connection and the STR layers417between related networks601.601bcombines. The7shows only two task units over the connection713offconnected to each other; there is a one-node-to-all node connection for each STR layer of the upper ACTION network of each task unitviii. Varying the weight on this link provides a means of simulating competition between the respective task units and thus respective tasks. The neural network system301The present application may be trained to reproducibly output a series of elements in a known and desired sequence order. Once trained, the output will work from every top ACTION network601.601bas a ""seeding pattern"" for the lower ACTION networks603a.603b.603cand every top ACTION network601.601binitiates the series of elements in the order in its output array605a.605bis specified. The entire sequence is generated in the correct order from a single ""seed"" into the upper ACTION network, while the outputs are hidden from it and the sequence from the lower ACTION networks603a.603b.603cis controlled.6also shows that the inputs to the ACTION networks and the outputs from the ACTION networks are numbers that may be hard-wired or software-mediated, depending on the system design, to accomplish tasks or subtasks. Every task unit306can only spend a single task, so if an upper neural network is connected to more than one lower neural network, as in6Each of the outputs of the lower neural networks must be subtasks of a single task. Description of the identification means303 The identification means303has means for storing sequences of elements together with information used to perform a classification of the sequences. The identification means303can be provided by a variety of SOM (Self-Organizing Map) units304a.304b; a self-organizing map is known to those skilled in the art as a classifier. A SOM is an unattended learning neural network that is modular (in the sense that each SOM is independent and trained, requires no retraining), and is suitable for applications that do not require re-generation of sequences (such as the Case in the present invention). Further details of the SOM can be found, for example, in Fausett, L. (1994), Fundamentals of Neural Networks: Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, ISBN-0-13-334186-0. The structure of a SOM includes an input layer801and an output layer803schematically in the8bbe shown, each layer nodes805having. Each node of the input layer801is configured to receive an input (represented by an input vector) and each input node is typically fully connected to each node on the output layer (shown only for one input node). There is also a weight associated with each connection from the input layer to the output layer. The input layer801may have any number of input nodes, but in general the number of input nodes should be greater than the dimension size of the output layer grid space (ie, if the output layer is 3x3, the dimension size is 3). As soon as trained is a SOM operational, receive an input and determine which node on the Output layer (best) corresponds to this input. Thus classified an SOM input by identifying a ""winning"" node on the Output layer. A preferred arrangement of the SOM system304with three SOM units304a.304b.304cis in8ashown, wherein each SOM unit was trained on permutations of different given tasks and stores them. For example, typical tasks performed by the SOM system304can be stored include:SOM1304a= Email, report, web search;SOM2304b= Simulations, report, phone call, proofreading;SOM3304c= Email, Team Conference, Assessment.etc. Description of the connections305a.305b The connections305a.305bprovide connections between an output from the SOM system304and inputs to the neural network system301for generating sequences of elements. In particular, the compounds305a.305bwith a knot on the output layer803a SOM unit304a.304bThis node, known as the ""winning node"", is determined as described above305a.305bcarries a weight between the winning knot309and each of the task units306that is the neural network system301turn off. Each of the first ends307a.307bthe connections305is with the winning knot309connected to the identified SOM unit and each of the second ends of the connections311.311bis preferably with a node on the STR layer417each of the top ACTION networks of the task units306connected. Training the sequence generator201 The training data that is used has a plurality of sets of ""previous tasks"" and ""subsequent tasks"", the first being an input to the SOM system304are provided (as described above) and the latter as an input to the neural network system301are provided. These ""previous"" and ""subsequent"" elements are the most closely watched sequences of user tasks (and subtasks, see below) and are referred to as such. Learning ""previous"" elements: SOM system304 As described above, each SOM unit undergoes a training phase before it can be used to classify inputs. For each of these SOM units304a.304b.304cthis includes formulating input vectors of tasks or subtasks and storing those tasks, then inputting the input vectors into the units. Each input vector has a permutation of the tasks, as in8cfor the unit304bshown. The output layer of the SOM unit304blearns in a manner known to those skilled in the art how to classify the permutations and the SOM unit304bsaves the tasks. A single node on the output layer corresponding to a given input permutation may identify the classification such that each of the nodes on the output layer defines a permutation of the tasks (or subtasks when the sequence generator is used to generate only sequences of subtasks). Learning ""subsequent"" elements: neural network system301for generating sequences of elements  Once the neural network system301and the SOM system304were independently trained to replicate the data having the ""previous"" and ""following"" sets (the training preferably takes place for several such sets), the combined sequence generator is trained. This training takes place by applying gain training, where the system ""tells"" the network how well it works and what is done by modifying weights on the links305a.305b, Accordingly, upon inspection, the output of the sequence generator201, as well as the output of the neural network system301is the weightings on the links305modified (if necessary) so that the output approaches the sequence of ""succeeding"" tasks and eventually replicates. The weights preferably have the following form:where k is the compound (305a.305b) represents ij a node (309) on a SOM unit, α represents a SOM unit (304aβk representsthe task unit to which the second end of the connection is connected (311.311b), M represents an associated node in the STR layer of the βk-Aufgabeneinheit t, is the time, Rmβk(t) is the activity of node m at time t, N is the dimension of the STR lattice which the STR layer (ie, the number of nodes), t is the maximum number of time steps required for a task unit to pass through its sequence of elements, and cr is the reward factor. The reward factor has the value of 1 if the output sequence is from the sequence generator201replicates the ""following"" sequence of sequences, and -1 if it does not. Operation of the sequence generator201  If the ""unseen"" tasks are tasks that the user has just performed, then the output of this embodiment is201thus a plan of tasks, which is at least partially one  Function of a previous set of tasks. In In practice, the present invention can be used if at least one processable event has already occurred has, and thus has a far-reaching application. Typical examples include following: SOFTWARE AGENT-INTERACTION Currently An agent interaction can be defined by plans that are in stored in a predefined plan directory. however For example, the present invention can be used to dynamically perform agent tasks to plan, as an input to receive the actions just completed be delivered and as output the most suitable events, the next are processed. Control Panel When the operation of a system involves sequential movements of control devices, such as valves in a drainage system, the selection of movements may depend in part on previous actions. For example, in a drainage system where there are a plurality of electronically operated valves, a task such as ""empty pipe in section n"" may ""deflate"" the general task, but this generic task may take several forms, each having alternative subtasks that correspond to the section to be emptied. A selection of the appropriate form may be learned in a manner described above such that in operation the sequence generator201selects an emptying function that matches the previous valve conditions (eg position of the valve). USER TASK PLANNING typically, A person has a set of tasks that span a certain period of time have to be completed. To perform these tasks most efficiently, it may be appropriate To take into account tasks which have just been completed, as this is another choice of can stimulate subsequent tasks as if the human being new had started to work. MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS: As is well known in the art, a critical issue in the development of a neural network is generalization: how well does the network make predictions for cases that are not in the training set? Neural networks, like other flexible non-linear estimation techniques, such as kernel regression and smoothed splines, may suffer from either under-fitting or over-fitting. The number and choice of training data used to train the neural network is critical to the following performance: in simple terms, the training data is used to provide an empirical solution (the system ""learns"" this empirical solution), from which a solution for all data can be extrapolated, so the selection of input data used for training should lead to a representative solution, avoiding the problems of over-fitting, under-fitting, and reducing noise, as described above , the identification means303provided by means other than a plurality of SOM units, and when provided by another arrangement of a neural network, these alternative means require similar attention to training data. In general, a SOM unit attempts to find clusters such that two clusters that are close together in the output layer803, Vectors near each other in the input space, but this requires ""a priori"" knowledge about relationships between inputs (nodes) having the input layer In the present invention, it may be the case that all inputs are independent of each other, or that there is insufficient information available about their relationships, in which case an alternative, but more restrictive, form of means of identification may exist303provided by certain nodes that store information about just completed tasks. With such an arrangement, the sequences generated for inputs are less useful than when a SOM system is used, since the identification means can only provide guaranteed solutions that correspond to the particular node (ie, for input data for which the identifier was explicitly trained). The neural network system301can be replaced by a recurrent network as Elmanix- or Hopfieldxnetworks, both of which are artificial neural networks, and biological neural  Network described in Zipser, ""Recurrent Network Model of the Neural Mechanism of Short-Term Active Memory,"" Neural Computation 3, 179-193, 1991.

Introduction A temporary Sequence storage and generation is important in our everyday lives. The sequences of actions we perform to accomplish tasks become learned as fixed automatic sequences, referred to as schemes, and then used in the planning of solutions. Thus, to Planning schemes are set up. The The problem addressed here is the user's work schedule a way to plan which your own preferences or preferences of the user. Such a system not only plans the order in which the Work is tackled at a high level, but also at a high level lower level in a work task. And the whole planning based on data of the user's preferred working patterns. This requires that the tasks performed by the user be learned be, as well as the temporary Sequence of subtasks that carry out a specific task are required, these are the schemata of the work actions of a User. Then the preferences the user to carry out learned from tasks in specific sequences to the schemas to use in the formation of a planned work plan. There are a number of neural networks that achieve temporal sequence storage and generation. Neural time delay networks (Waibel, 1989; Waibel et al., 1989) implement Hook's embedding theorem, which states that measurements of a time series generated by an underlying dynamic system can always allow underlying dynamics to be reconstructed using an embedding vector of a delayed set of elements of the measured series. Recurrent models include: the Hopfield spin-glass approach (Hopfield, 1982); Networks with context neurons (Jordan, 198 ?, Elman 198?) And extensions of the Elman network (Wang & Arbib, 1990; 1996); the approach of ""crumbling history"" (Reiss & Taylor, 1991, Taylor & Reiss, 1992) We do not use the above models in our system The Hopfield model has problems with the length of the sequence being generated The Elman mesh approach uses associative chaining to create sequences, resulting in multiple representations for the same outputs, which is computationally expensive The ""brittle history"" approach encounters problems due to its method of sequence generation during design , He uses the last edition of the model as the next input,  during a concurrent process between different modules interrupting the output (ie, generating the incorrect output), creates competition between different sequences than originally intended. We require that a system learns long sequences in a way that is computationally less extensive than Elman meshes, and that the sequence generation is done in an ""internal"" manner as soon as sequence generation is started, thus turning the frontal lobe of Primates too. The Frontal lobes of complex cortical and subcortical structures. People can through exercise temporary Sequences big Learning length; additionally shows proof of unicellular recordings during one monkey engineered sequence generation (Tanji & Shima, 1994, Halsband et al, 1994) a division (chunking) during of sequencing learning occurs. A classification is the process by which short subsequences of actions are linked together to a reminder of all the actions performed by this ""chunk"" part to deliver. this makes possible the use of the scheduling neurons to perform a subsequence when she occurs in a total sequence. Thus, no multiple representations occur of subsequences. To the above-mentioned sequence-learning part to solve the problem we use a model based on the structure of the frontal lobes. We begin in section 2 with a description of a neural Network, which is a basic temporary sequence storage and generation performs by learning short sequences up to a length of four. Describe in section 3 we like longer sequences using the short-sequence learner can be learned and regenerated. How these learned sequences can be used to work preferences of the user is described in section 4. 2. The ACTION network 2.1. architecture As mentioned above, is the first stage of building the system to develop a network that is capable to the temporary Sequence storage and generation of work actions. The one used for it Structure is the ACTION network (Taylor, 1995, Taylor & Alavi, 1996), a recurrent neural network. This is a schematic Version of the cortical and subcortical structures of the frontal lobes, being referred to as the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit becomes. The frontal lobes are important for a well-functioning memory entertainment and there are a number of separate circuits (Alexander, DeLong & Knit, 1986). The motor circuit is important for generating temporary sequences of motor actions from memory (Tanji & Shima, 1994; Halsband et al, 1994). Various versions of the ACTION NETWORK have been used to perform a variety of tasks, from psychologically delayed response tasks (Monchi & Taylor, 1995, 1997, 1998) to sequences of motor actions with delays (Taylor, 1998, Taylor & Taylor, 1998). The1shows the front areas modeled for the ACTION network version used here. The ACTION network has two cortical areas, SMA (supplemental motor cortex) and PMC (pre-motor cortex), basal ganglia, thalamus (THL) and STN (sub-thalamus nucleus). The basal ganglia consists of two layers, STR (striatum) and globus pallidus, each of which is modeled as its internal and external segments GPi and GPe. Neurophysiological and psychological studies have shown that SMA is responsible for movements from memory, whereas PMC generates movements from a visual instruction (Tanji & Shima, 1994, Halsband et al, 1994, Passingham 1987, 1993) and both are required to produce a visual statement learn new sequence (Passingham 1987, 1993). The modeled neurons have a medium rate of fire, with all but the ON and OFF neurons leaky integrators. This model can sustain an activity over a long period of time because of the many control loops that exist in its structure. Most of the subcortical structure provides competition for stimulating input and inhibiting output to the GPi via STN and STR, respectively. When the GPi is inhibited, this releases the inhibition it exerts on THL, which then allows THL to become spontaneously active. Active thalamic neurons then cause a reversion of activity between SMA and THL. This results in sustained activity over long periods of time which can be switched off by removing the inhibition of GPi from the STR, thereby positively stimulating GPi, again inhibiting THL. This removes the possibility of a retroreflective activity between SMA and THL. The net effect of the complete basal ganglion is a de-inhibitor.  1, The ACTION network, where an SMA is an additional motor area, PMC a pre-motor cortex, STN a subthalamic nucleus, GPe an external area of globus pallidus, GPi an internal area of globus pallidus, THL a thalamus, STR a striatum, IN (ON) is an input layer and OUT (OUT) is an output layer. Open arrows indicate stimulating weights, full arrows indicate inhibitory compounds. The System consists of a number of ACTION network modules, each one Module learns a sequence up to four work actions. The customizable Weightings are: ON to SMA, SMA to OFF and SMA to STR, which is one Reduction of earlier Models is (Taylor, 1998: Taylor & Taylor, 1998). each Work action is represented by a specific number, and it's these numbers that are used as inputs to each module become. The output of the module must regenerate the input. One Training starts with the presentation the first two entries of the sequence, the correct outputs must be as Response to the external suggestions are generated. As soon as this done correctly the first input is presented to the module in response to it it has to produce the first edition, followed by the second edition, the second output being generated internally by the network. Thus, the first input is used to sequence regeneration and is known as the ""seeding"" input. If the length of two sequences can be generated by ""seeding"", the first three entries are presented to the network and again the Correct three issues spent in the correct order become. Thereafter, the network is again ""seeded"" and the three issues have to are generated correctly, with the second and the third output generated internally. This is repeated for the length of four sequences. If the wrong output is generated, the training returns to the previous one Step back. Weightings are updated using Hebbian and Gain learning rules so that the information the network receives is whether the output was correct or incorrect, not what the output should have been. A gain learning rule for a weight wijhas the form:.DELTA.wij= r ε uiuj(1)where uk isthe output of the neuron k, ε is the learning rate, and r is the reward, defined by:r = 1, if output is correct, otherwise r = -1 (2) 2.3 Results By using appropriate weighting initializations and parameter selection, sequences of length four can be learned. The number of trials required for the training process using different initializations ranges from 180 to 1800.2shows some neurons that are active during the generation of a sequence. Simulations have shown that certain areas are important for learning and generating sequences. The model of1has removed STN and GPe, although some sequences can be learned and generated, other sequences can not. The sequences in which it failed can be derived from the model of1be learned and produced. 3. Longer sequences At this level, the system can only learn working sequences up to a length of four. Using ACTION network modules in a hierarchical system, the sequence length can be expanded in powers of four. Thus, two layers of ACTION modules mean that sequences up to 16 can be learned and regenerated. The second layer ACTION networks are referred to as the first layer modules or chunking modules that stimulate the low order modules (3). Of the only difference in architecture between scheduling modules and low-order modules is the inclusion of compounds from the out layer of the scheduling module to the low level ones Order. The outputs of the scheduling modules thus act as a ""seed"" for the modules lower Order. Thus, while the modules of lower order on a continuous sequence up to a length four trained, the scheduling modules trained to the first and then generate every fourth consecutive input as Answer to the ""sowing"" with the first input. Thus, for the Sequence {1, 2, 3, ..., 14, 15, 16} four low-order modules to train one of the sequences {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15, 16} while the scheduling module the first order is trained to produce {1, 5, 9, 13} what the four source inputs of the Low-order networks are. The entire sequence will be in the correct Sequence generated by ""sowing"" the scheduling module, the outputs of the scheduling module are hidden and the sequence generation is controlled by the modules of low order.  3, The arrangement of ACTION networks to generate a sequence of length 1 to 16, showing the first layer scheduling module and the four low order modules. The advantage of this hierarchical structure of ACTION networks is the reusability of low order modules by many scheduling modules. A complete sequence is learned only once, there need not be a number of scheduling modules that produce exactly the same sequence. However, a user can solve a particular task in a number of different ways, depending on what the work entails. Thus, in a group of sequences that can solve the same task, there can be subsequences that are common. Rather than representing the subsequence by many low order modules, it is advantageous, due to space and speed, to reuse the low order module that can already generate the subsequence.4shows four scheduling modules, which are all possible user solutions for a particular task, sharing common subsequences.  4, The arrangement of reusable low order scheduling modules; each one  Box an ACTION network of the form of1represents. 4. Learning of user preferences The Sections 2 and 3 have the basis of the system for learning the sequences described that a user performs to work tasks to solve. Now, the learning of the sequences in which the user is described will be described the implementation prefers work. The user preferences are from the system used to get a pool of pending work tasks at one To arrange the way the user would have chosen. Two possible solutions are discussed: (a) Task level sequences and (b) task levels, both of which use a contention process between scheduling modules. The learned preferences form the importance (salien ce), which is the degree of preference for an object is compared to other objects. In the case of the procedure (a) Importance is the preference a specific sequence of sequence tasks over one different order of the same tasks; for method (b) is the Importance the preference a certain task over all other tasks in a given pool of tasks. 4.1 Architecture The architecture is the same for both methods of competition and involves the addition of inhibitory connections between the striata partition modules (5). All existing modules are linked to all other modules via these weights, with no self-recursion.  5, The competing inhibitory weights connecting striata of ACTION networks, where the competing weight is denoted by c. 4.2 Sequences of Task Level Competition The Level of competition of sequences of tasks requires that the sequences that are learned and regenerated from tasks consist. Then the stored sequences are the preferred working patterns the user. There are a number of problems with this procedure. Due to the method of sequence generation by ""sowing"" with the first pattern all sequences compete with one of the tasks in the pool start, in the competition, if the sequence is just the one existing in the pool Contains tasks or not. This can cause that plans which contain all the tasks contained in the pool Tasks and others that are not included, or plans that just some of the tasks in the pool included. This method for learning user preferences can not generalize if the pool is a specific group of Contains tasks on which the system was not trained. So we continue to the competition on the individual task level. 4.3 Task level competition In In this case, the sequences involved in the competition are the Sequences representing the different stages used for solution to be used in a task. Thus, the regenerated sequence exists from the task, followed by the order of subtasks that to the solution be used for this task. If all present in the pool Tasks presented to the system are the only sequences that are regenerated that are, which start with one of the tasks in the pool. 4.3.1 Training To train the user preferences, the sequence in which the user desires to perform certain tasks is used as a template. The task name is used to ""seed"" all sequences beginning with that entry Thus, during importance training, all the task names contained in the data stream are simultaneously presented to the system One module is in the preferred order for one of the tasks the winner (ie, most active) at the end of the sequence regeneration .This winner is then compared to the template and the weights are updated according to a modified gain training law .The competing weights that are negative are called cij, which is the weight of Module j identifies to module i The update rule is defined as:ci * j= cij+ 0.5 reward actjacti *(3)cji *= cji *- 0.5 reward actjacti *(4)in whichReward = 1 if winning module matches template Reward = -1 if winning module does not match template (5)and i * represents the winning module and actk isthe average output of a striatal neuron during the competing process of module k. The Equation (3) thus has the effect of changing the weights of the winning module. These will be less negative if the winner is correct, taking into account, that these compounds are inhibitory; thus the combined reduce inhibiting action. If the winner is wrong, will be the weights are more negative, allowing him to compete in the next attempt does not win. The equation (4) controls the weights of the winning module to all other modules that were stimulated. If the winner is correct, the inhibiting weights become strengthened to all other active modules, if wrong, the Weightings weakened. Equations (3) and (4) only work to the competing weights to change from active modules thus become sooner learned importance for Tasks that are not involved in the current competition, not changed. As soon as the competing weights were learned in such a way that the first task of the data stream is the winner, if the specific Pool of tasks presented This task is removed from the pool and the training continue with the remaining tasks using the same procedure. For example, there is a pool of tasks {T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6} with a preferred user order of: T2, T6, T1, T5, T3, T4, The training begins with an input to the trained scheduling modules of all tasks in the pool. We require from this first stage that T2 isthe winning module. Training continues using the equations above until this is the case. The next training phase removes T2from the pool of tasks to provide the following pool {T1, T3, T4, T5, T6}, for which the preferred order T6, T1, T5, T3, T4is. The training then needs to modify the weights such that T6 isthe next winner. T6is then removed from the pool of tasks and training goes as before for the remaining four tasks continue using their preferred order. The context resulting from previous tasks is not included at this point, but will be discussed in the later hippocampus stage of the project. 4.3.2 Creating a plan from a pool of tasks We would like now put a pool of tasks in an order, assuming that the system has a number of the user's preferred working patterns has learned in a way that the user finds acceptable. In order to arrange this pool of tasks, all tasks are in the Subdivision modules entered. The scheduling modules, with one of the Duties as their origin input, become active and a winning one Module is found that as a first issue a specific task Has. This task is then first in the current work plan given and removed from the pool of tasks. The resulting Pool of tasks will then be entered and a new winner will be found, which is the second entry in the work plan; this new winner will be removed from the pool. This method competition and removing the winner goes on until only one task left in the pool is, at this point she will be last in the proposed Work plan placed. 4.4.3 Results We presented preferred work sequences to trained systems: 2 tasks, 4 tasks, 6 tasks, and 8 tasks (5 simulations each). In each case, the preferred order was learned and could be regenerated. Table I shows the average trials required to learn the preferred sequence order for the different number of tasks. Table I 6shows two graphs of the average results obtained from the case of the 8 tasks. The6 (a)indicates the average number of trials required to get the nth task in the correct position, assuming the previous n-1 tasks are already correctly located. The second graph indicates the average number of tasks that are in their correct positions (this does not require the position n to correctly place the previous n-1 position) at each stage when a new position is filled correctly. The6 (a)Figure 4 shows that for a larger number of tasks, when one task is correctly arranged, the general trend for the number of attempts to correctly place the next task is less. While the6 (b)indicates that as soon as 4 tasks are correctly arranged, 7 tasks are correctly arranged on average (the number of correct orders actually ranges from 5 to 8, with no modules having 7 tasks arranged correctly since this is impossible). We find that for sufficiently long sequences with 6 and 10 tasks (in addition to 8) the results of the6 (a)be essentially repeated. For length 4, the average number of attempts required to train each position is almost the same. The7shows the average number of trials for lengths 2, 4, 6 and 8 sequences over each 20 simulations to learn the preferred order of tasks. The rough doubling of the average number of trials from length 4 (5.15 trials) to length 6 (9.5) to length 8 (20.45) indicates that, on average, 40 trials are required to train the importance of 10 tasks.  5. Training the whole Systems At At this point we have described the architectures used be a task tasks and their composite subtasks sequences to learn; and how basic user preferences can be learned between the trained modules to plan a work in isolation. We have not described the mechanism as provided a data stream consisting of tasks and subtasks, the the daily Using a user describes a complete system can be built. One Example of the data stream is: email management, open email, reply, archive, conclude 0, write report, open Word processor, save, close, 0, etc. Where 0 is the end the current task displays. The sequence is divided into sequences, starting from the first non-zero entry to the next zero entry. Thus, the sequences on which the system is trained: email management, open email, answer, archive and then write report, open word processor, save, close. The email sequence is trained first. The first stage involves directing the sequence of names through a translator to produce a sequence of numbers that the system can explicitly use. In this case, the sequence would be numbers: 56, 90, 82, 80, 35. We want to see if this complete sequence exists, so the first number representing the task is presented to the system. All modules that are ""seeded"" by this input become active and generate their respective sequence.The generated sequences can then be compared to the presented sequence  If the sequence does not yet exist, the length 3 and length 4 subsequences contained in the sequence 56, 90, 82, 80, 35 are compared with the previously issued sequences to check if a module of the low order produces exactly this sequence. If a subsequence was learned earlier, then no new low order module is trained for that subsequence. For example, if the sequence 82, 80, 35 were generated by a low order module, a new low order module is trained on the rest of the sequence 56, 90. The length 1 and length 2 subsequences are not checked to save time and to not make too many modules with only one or two output (s). The low-order modules have now been trained for this sequence, which must now be interconnected by a scheduling module. In this case, the sequence on which the scheduling module is trained is 56, 82, which are the ""sow"" inputs of the two low-order modules If no partial sequences existed, then the training sequence would be 56, 35, but this was determined by the Existence of the sequence 82, 80, 35. Once the scheduling module has been trained, the sequence 56, 82 is again presented to the system to stimulate the correct outputs of the scheduling modules and the two low order modules that generate the entire sequence, thus training the scheduling module Weightings from the OUT layer of the scheduling module to the ON layers of the low-order modules Now, when the scheduling module is provided with the input 56, the entire output will be the original sequence 56, 90, 82, 80, 35. This method will then repeated for all remaining task sequences in the data stream. Of the Data stream also provides the preferences the user for a task order that can be extracted by Removing the first non-zero entry and the first non-zero entry to zero. In our example, that would this will deliver the sequence: email administration, write report, etc. All have newly created scheduling modules the competing weights c initialize to all others Scheduling modules which also produce the reciprocal weights. Before an importance training begins, the system is tested to see if the preferences can already be generated if the correct order can be generated then it will open the training is omitted. As mentioned above, The user can solve a task in more than one way, though This takes place, it is most likely that it is a procedure which the user prefers, so this must be considered be while of an importance learning. 6. Create and using a plan With one according to the above Section trained system can be a basic plan for one Pool of tasks using the procedure described in section 4.3.2 Procedure are generated. Due to the method of learning from Importance of the task layer when the pool of tasks such is that the system never trains on such a pool It can, using the learned user information generalize to produce its best estimate. If the Work plan is generated, each task is performed as required for the sub-tasks to be generated, this in turn can be a competitor between schemes for cause the same task. 7. Conclusions We have detailed a system described to a specific problem to solve, namely using a work in a user friendly way to plan the learned habits of the user. The system can To learn a scheme of a user of any length simply by adding further layers of Eintei development modules. The used division trying to strike a balance between reuse existing learned subsequences and learning many short ones Sequences by reusing modules, the short sequences produce. user preferences a work order be learned, so far up to a length of 10 tasks. The education of plans from schemas can be generalized. Further Work is required to create a context of mental state of the User based on the time of day or the day of the week. A context also helps in choosing the correct schema a task of several solutions to solve. references Alexander GE., DeLong MR. and Knitting PL., 1986; Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex.

161,DE-60102198-T2,Braking process in an integrated traction drive and braking system ,2000,"BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The The present invention relates generally to electrically controlled pneumatic Train brakes, computer controlled train braking systems and propulsion systems and in particular the braking in the brake and drive systems as well as their integration. computerized Brake systems are well known, such as the New York Air Corporation deliver CCBI and CCBII. These systems offer a computer control of the pneumatic control unit for by the entire train running air pressure lines. This allows the pneumatic control of locomotive and individual wagon brakes. Lately, the industry has become electrically controlled to provide electropneumatic brakes on every wagon. This has led to the electrically controlled pneumatic ECP system, which is independent of computer-controlled braking system is. An overview of such a system is EP-60, available at the New York Air Brake Corporation. So as present implemented, running the ECP system in the locomotive parallel to that of the conventional pneumatic locomotive train controls. Two brake valves are one of which is the brake valve for pneumatic braking and the other is the ECP brake valve. Be equal for the individual systems used separate displays. The locomotive or the locomotive network does not respond to the brake commands the ECP system, as the locomotives respond to pneumatic signals via lines. Also features the ECP system over its own discrete input from the event recorder and the Locomotive controls for the determination of penalties. The Drive system on the locomotive is also one of the ECP system and Separated from the convention of pneumatic locomotive and train controls System. The Drive system includes the drive and dynamic braking as well various additional functions related to braking, for example Sand scatter and power switch. In general, they are together adjacent locomotives a composite and have a leading locomotive. The leading locomotive supplies the electrical and pneumatic controls to the adjacent ones Locomotives. There is also a distributed power system available at the leading locomotive a composite of the leading locomotive another group is separated by wagons in the train. In the The two leading locomotives have radio transmission over the past communicated. The one from the lead locomotive specified controls are over Transfer radio to the remote management locomotive. This resulted in a doubling of the locomotive controls at both Connected. In WO 99/24298 is a train brake system with a Kabelzugleitung and a brake line and an electropneumatic brake control discloses, which is connected to the brake line and over the Zugleitung emits electro-pneumatic brake signals. In addition includes the train brake system is a drive control system. However will the distributive energy over Radio is delivered to the remote locomotives, and it is not possible to drive information from the remote locomotive to the lead locomotive over the Pass train line. In documentUS 5,303,157For example, there is disclosed a locomotive control system having a single handle that can be moved between a maximum drive position and an idle position. With such single-handle locomotive control, an adequate mix of dynamic and pneumatic braking based on handle movement can be achieved. This system does not show a remote drive controller that transmits a brake request to the leading drive controller and no leading drive controller that transmits a drive signal in response to the brake request from the remote controller. With the implementation of electrically controlled pneumatic or electropneumatic Braking there was a discussion about the desirability of integrating the computer-controlled braking systems in the electrically controlled pneumatic Braking systems. The present system provides integrated operation of brake and drive systems for a train, which is a train brake line, passing through locomotives and wagons on the train, electropneumatic brakes on the train Locomotives and wagons owns, which with the train brake line and connected to a power grid. A brake control on the locomotives gives off brake commands that is a drive system on the locomotives connected to the grid, and a drive control on the locomotives gives drive commands. The method of operating the brake and drive systems includes determining whether the brake command signal is a brake command initiated by the pneumatic or electrical system or a brake command initiated by an operator.  A brake signal and an emergency drive signal are transmitted in the network for emergency brake commands, which are triggered by the pneumatic and electrical system and by the operator. A brake signal is transmitted via the train brake line for brake commands triggered by the operator and the pneumatic system. If the train a leading one and has remote drive control, transmits the leading drive control the remote drive control instructions for the appropriate brake control the remote control for transmission a brake signal over the train brake line for Brake commands triggered by the operator and the pneumatic system. If the remote drive controller transmits a brake request to the leading drive controller, transmits the leading drive system a brake drive signal in response to the brake request. The remote drive control and the drive systems only respond on drive signals. The remote drive control transfers locally recorded pneumatic and electrical system and operator-triggered braking requirements. The remote drive controller transmits the brake request, until the local, which created the braking request event has, stops and the remote drive controller receives a brake signal. The premier Drive control gives the brake request to its brake control off, and the leading one Brake control transmits a brake signal and assigns the leading Drive control to transmit a brake drive signal. The leading brake control has the leading one Drive control on, to the remote drive control instructions for the to transfer appropriate brake control to the remote controller, about a brake signal over the train brake line for Operator and pneumatic system-triggered brake commands to transmit. If the brake system comprises a locomotive brake pipe extending through adjacent locomotives extends, and the locomotive brakes too connected to the locomotive brake line transmits a locomotive brake signal via the locomotive brake line for train and locomotive brake commands. braking signals can over the Transfer train brake line be, and drive signals using radio, if the Train is operated in a pneumatic mode. Brake signals and drive signals can about that Network are transmitted, when the train is operating in an electrical mode. The System includes a single brake control, the locomotive and Train brake commands outputs. A first brake control process is with the brake control connected and transmits a wagon brake signal above the Net for Train brake. A second brake control process is with the brake control connected and transmits a locomotive brake signal over the Locomotive brake line for train and locomotive brake commands. The Brake system can have a pneumatic and an electric mode to have. The first brake control process transmits wagon brake signals via the Network in electrical mode, and the second brake control process transmits wagon brake signals over the Pull brake line for the pneumatic mode. The second brake control process transmits locomotive brake signals via the Locomotive brake pipe in both mode. The Brake control gives a system-triggered brake command or a Operator-initiated Brake command. The first brake control process transmits a brake signal via the Network for System and operator triggered Braking commands. The second brake control process transmits an emergency brake signal over the Train and locomotive brake lines for operator-initiated brake commands and those of the pneumatic system. The brake control has one leading and trailing mode and gives the brake command signals only in the leading one Mode off. Other Goals, advantages and innovations of the present invention will be apparent the following detailed description of the invention in a joint consideration with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Even though the current one Brake system using the EP-60 electropneumatic train brake system and CCBI / CCBII computer controlled locomotive brake system as an example of describes two systems that can be integrated the present integrated system using other similar ones pneumatic EAB and electropneumatic ECP systems for traction and Locomotive brake controls are implemented. An overview of the system architecture is in1shown. A computerized locomotive brake system10is shown as CCB. It controls the brake pipe train line21, It is an electropneumatic train brake system12connected, which is shown as EP-60, and controls an electropneumatic train line40, An integrated locomotive computer (ILC)29is with the CCB10and the EP-6012connected. A system for distributive energy DP14is also provided and with the ILC29connected. The ILC29is also with a drive system16Connects and transmits information to the event recorder30, An integrated display32is also at the ILC29connected. For non-locomotive system integration applications, notably when the ILC connection to the EP-6012is not an operator interface unit or ECP display44available, which is connected to the EP-60, and a separate event recorder30Ais connected to the EP-60. The event recorder30can be a separate and stand-alone device or in the ILC29be integrated. If it is a separate event recorder, it is the same event recorder as30A, The partitioning of the operation of the different operations performed by EP-60 and CCB is in2shown. The EP-60 receives CCB setup and display information. There are outputs to the power switch PCS of the locomotive system and to the EP trainline control. The EP-60 is responsible for the EP trainline brake call, trainline power management, train composition and order, and other AAR function requirements. The CCB receives inputs from the CCB setup and display, brake handle commands and penalty commands. It provides outputs to the PCS and other various locomotive inputs / outputs. It also controls the brake line, the20Lead and the13Line and local brake cylinder controls. The CCB is responsible for brake line loading, brake handle interpretation, brake line emergency management, penalty interpretation, locomotive brake cylinder control, multi-unit operation or MU (hoop and independent) functions, and the implementation of locomotive-specific requirements. The Interactions and the transfers of signals and controls between EP-60 and CCB are related to a standard or pneumatic Braking and electric braking explained. An example of the computer-controlled locomotive brake system10in3includes an electropneumatic control unit (EPCU)20acting on input signals to control the pressure on the brake line21responds, the independent application and release line (# 20)22and the operation line (# 13)23and the brake cylinders24in his locomotive. The independent application and dissolution line22and the operation line23run through the entire locomotive network and allow independent control of the locomotive brakes as opposed to controlling the pneumatic brakes in each car through the brake pipe21that runs through the train. The electrical communication and control of the locomotives in the composite runs over the 27-pin mu cable25, This is generally controlled by the drive control system (not shown). Shown is a computer-controlled brake system10for example as a CCBII, which is an integrated processor module IPM27This includes the pneumatic control unit20electrically controlled. The IPM27receives inputs from an electronic brake valve EBV26with an automatic brake handle26Afor controlling the train brakes via the brake line21and an independent brake handle26Bto control the locomotive brakes via the independent line22and the operation line23, The EBV26is an operator brake control. An integrated locomotive computer ILC29connects the IPM to an event recorder30and the displays32, The event recorder30can be a separate item or in the ILC29be integrated. Penalties, such as alarm and overspeed, are inputs to the ILC29, The drive system16communicates with the leading drive  system29, The ILC communicates with other locomotives in its network via the MU Zugleitung25, The IPM27is connected to locomotive systems (not shown) and provides typical outputs, such as a power cut-off signal PCS, emergency sanding signal ES and emergency solenoid valve EMV. The IPM27can be in the distributed stream DP14be integrated and would via the radio module33Communicate with the other locomotives in the composite, but also be distributed over the entire train. A train-end radio31communicates with the Zugendevorrichtung. The connection between the IPM27, the brake valve26and the electropneumatic control unit20takes place via a common bus. The proposed connection, which is an AAR standard, is a LonWork network, with each of the modules forming a node on the neural network. The connection between the IPM27and the ILC29is a standard serial link, such as an RS422 HDLC. The system described so far is well known and need not be described in more detail. The controls of an electrically controlled pneumatic brake system ECP of the prior art is known asEP 60illustrated as available, for example, from the New York Air Brake Corporation. The electrically controlled pneumatic brakes include a traction power supply TPS41in the battery power from the locomotive to power for the EP train line40is converted. This is an electrical line that runs throughout the train and provides electrical power and communication with EP-60 brakes on each wagon and, if available, on locomotives. A train line communication controller TCC42is to the EP train line40connected as a node in the neural network. A wagon ID node is represented as a node in the network and is part of the EP-60 system. In the older technique, the TCC has42no control over the pneumatic train lines21.22and23, It merely controls communication by going through the EP train line40either gives or receives information. So it can only communicate with other locomotives on the train, which TCC trainline controls42or have EP nodes on the network and with the EP train line40are connected. Even though the EP trainline is shown as a line through each wagon on the train is, it should be noted that the EP neural network via radio or other wireless connections can work. As implemented in the prior art, the ECP brake system operates in parallel with that of conventional pneumatic or computer controlled locomotive train controls. Two brake valves are provided, one being the pneumatic brake valve and the other being the EP brake valve. Similarly, separate displays are provided. The locomotive or locomotive network does not respond to the braking commands issued by the EP locomotive system. Also, the EP system has its own discrete inputs from the event recorder30Aand the locomotive controls to determine penalties. The integration of computer-controlled braking systems10in the electrically controlled pneumatic braking system12is achieved by interconnecting these systems as nodes on a common network as shown. The integration results in the presence of only one brake control valve, the CCB control valve26, and in the elimination of the ECP control valve. Also, there is no separate access to the event recorder30, the Zugendevorrichtung and a display for the TCC42required and is from the computer control brake section10available in the ILC or directly from the ILC. Access to the penalties and other locomotive controls for the TCC42is also done by the computer control brake system10in or directly from the ILC. Finally, the locomotive brake capability is provided under the electronically controlled TCC pneumatic system42to stand. As in3pictured is the ILC29to the TCC42in locomotive system integration applications directly connected by, for example, an RS 422 HDLC serial communications link. This provides access to the event recorder30over the ILC29, For a non-integrated application, the TCC42its own operator interface (not shown)44to have. The train control signal from the brake valve26will be sent to the IPM27delivered, and depending on whether the IPM27in pneumatic or electrical mode, it controls the electro-pneumatic control unit20for controlling the brake line21or gives the brake command signals to the TCC42off, the electric train or wagon brake signals via the EP train line40emits. The IPM27does not reduce the surge tank (not shown) in response to the movements of the automatic brake valve handle in the EP mode, as would be the case in the pneumatic mode. So the brake line remains21fully charged in electrical mode. All ECP-equipped locomotives respond to the control signal on the EP trainline40to apply their brakes in response to an ECP operation. At the same time, the leading and possibly remote locomotives are laying out with ECP  The proportional pneumatic brake signal is sent to the independent brake application and release line22at. The signal on this line is monitored by the trailing locomotive units that have no ECP capability and operate the locomotive brakes accordingly. A switching or setting process tells the IPM controller27with whether it should work in pneumatic or in electrical control mode. The IPM27forms in combination with the EBV26in3a brake controller that gives locomotive and train brake commands. The TCC42forms a first with the brake control27.26Connected brake control and transmits a wagon brake signal on the network or the EP train line40for train brake commands. A second brake control, which is the electropneumatic control unit20is also with the brake control27.26connected and transmits a locomotive brake signal on the locomotive brake line, which is the independent line22is for locomotive brake commands. For distributed energy has the integrated locomotive computer29in combination with the IPM27an interface to the drive system16and the locomotive systems with the brake system for transmitting drive signals via TCC42on the distant locomotives. The actuation and solution of the locomotive brakes using independent guidance22can as well as bail-off release without using the actuation cable23or the brake line21be achieved. Consequently, on the actuating line23be waived. As discussed above, the brake control has27.26a pneumatic mode and an electric mode. The default mode for starting and certain types of failure is the pneumatic mode. In electric mode gives the brake control27.26Train line brake signals via the train line40for the wagons and locomotives that have ECP brakes and with the train cable40are connected. In pneumatic mode gives the brake control27.26the train or wagon brake signals on the brake line21from. Both in electrical and pneumatic mode, the control unit gives20Locomotive brake signals via the locomotive brake line or the independent brake line22from. A general overview of the brake valve control is in4shown. The EBV26Provides inputs for automatic grip, independent grip, and bail-off release into the CCB, which also performs application-specific requirements for the locomotive. In a conventional or pneumatic mode it controls the electro-pneumatic control unit20for controlling the brake line21, In electrical mode finds a communication between the EP-6012and the CCB10instead of the EP train line40controls. In electric mode, the operation of the automatic handle26Afrom the IPM27processes and supplies train brake signals to the TCC42, The TCC42then gives an electrical feed signal to the EP train line40from. It also sends the electrical train signal back to the IPM, and the IPM27in turn supplies braking commands to the electropneumatic control unit20, The electropneumatic control unit20then supplies a suitable brake cylinder pressure for the brake cylinder24this locomotive. The TCCs42on other remote leading locomotives give the received train brake commands to their IPMs27who use their electropneumatic control unit20to operate their brakes or brake cylinders24Taxes. The TCC42commands her IPM27also the electropneumatic control unit20the delivery of a brake signal to the independent line22, This allows the pneumatic actuation of the trailing brakes, which allows the locomotive network to have non-ECP equipped trailing locomotives or the trailing ECP locomotives could have turned off or deactivated their electrical mode. Thus, in the electric mode, the brake cylinder control function of the electropneumatic control unit20from the TCC42controlled, and not by the EBV26, Because the independent line22also be used to deliver pneumatic signals to trailing locomotives in electric mode, must also provide arrangements for the operation of the independent handle26Bbe taken in electrical mode. When the independent brake handle26Bis operated in electrical mode, the EBV gives26through the IPM27send a signal to the TCC. The TCC42then in turn passes through the IPM27a command back to the ECP control unit20for delivering a pneumatic brake signal via the independent line22, If the EP train line40and the TCC42have the capabilities, they give a locomotive brake signal to the EP-equipped locomotives and not to the wagons, which also with the EP line40are connected. When the automatic handle26Aand the independent handle26Bboth brake at the same time, the more restrictive brake command is used to control the locomotive brakes. Similarly, distributed current signals can be on the EP line40be sent to the address of the remote leading locomotives in pneumatic and electrical mode. This would be distributed stream commands, status and exceptions  include nals. The control26.27may specify a system initiated emergency brake command or an operator initiated emergency brake command as in5shown. The operator-initiated brake commands come from the brake valve26in an emergency grip position. The system-initiated brake commands include an emergency state of the electrical system or an emergency state of the pneumatic system. The emergency states of the electrical system include EP-60 system standards and CCB system standards. The emergency states of the pneumatic system include break-in-two and Fireman's brake valve. For emergency states gives the control27.26Signals to the TCC42which issues an emergency brake signal on the network for system and operator initiated emergency brake commands. The control27.26gives commands to the control unit20Making an emergency stop signal on the train and locomotive brake lines21.22for operator initiated and pneumatic system initiated emergency brake commands. Consequently, for emergency braking commands of the electrical system, only the ECP brake is actuated, while for operator and pneumatic system emergency brake commands the ECP and pneumatic brake systems are actuated. The train brake signals and the locomotive brake signals are on the trainline40transmitted as proportion of brake signals. An emergency solenoid EMV under the control of the TCC42can be parallel to the electropneumatic control unit20to be provided. If the distributed power system DP includes the emergency state solenoid valve, the TCC can42together control the solenoid valve. The TCC42controls the electrical reset, and IPM27Controls the pneumatic reset after an operator initiated or pneumatic system initiated emergency condition. The TCC42Controls the electrical reset after a state of emergency initiated by the electrical system and after the automatic handle26Aa certain time in full service or suppression, before the release position can be selected. The integration use of the distributive power system for detecting and controlling the emergency braking will be described with reference to FIG6described. It should also be noted that in terms of7can be executed using the distributive energy system to be discussed. Both can produce brake requests to a remote leading unit.6Figure 12 is a diagram of the functional component and interaction of a leading DP unit and a DP-controlled or remote unit. Each has a DP function section, an ECP function section and the various locomotive controls. These locomotive controls include a locomotive brake cylinder controller BC, a power cut control PCS, air brake emergency AB EM state, emergency sanding EM SAND, and an emergency solenoid EMV. The two units are by the train train40connected. The signals via the EP brake line40are illustrated as ECP command, ECP status / exceptions for the EP system and DP command, and DP status / exceptions for the distributive power system. The Emergency brake control in DP mode operates together with the existing one ECP and computer brake emergency brake control logic for execution of Trainline emergency brake. If it is not in DP mode, the DP controlled acts Unit like any other wagon on the train. All emergency braking applications be from the leadership unit controlled and managed. The DP system is capable of both the electronic train line emergency states (only ECP) like the conventional ones pneumatic emergency conditions (Brake line) to edit. The DP guide unit and the DP-controlled Unit possess the local ability to Recording of emergency conditions and subsequent transfer an emergency condition request to the ECP leadership (HEU). The DP guide unit detects the remote emergency condition based on the reception from DP control unit status information and / or exception messages. The DP system is able to do that ECP system to initiate emergency braking commands from the leading unit. The leading one Unit has the ability a conventional brake pipe emergency rate or a reduction after detecting a pneumatic emergency on the DP-controlled To demand unity. As held on top can the status information and / or exception reports also the penalty status lock in. Both state of emergency and penalty conditions or statuses are considered braking requirements. It should be noted that when the system is in its conventional non-DP mode, the conventional braking system on the DP controlled unit detects pneumatic emergency conditions such as break-in twos, remote automatic handle to emergency status ETC, and as a result goes into a conventional pneumatic emergency state. After entering a conventional state of emergency, the electropneumatic control unit initiates20the state of emergency for a certain amount of time. The electric sand scattering is also set to a certain amount of time, as is the one  position of the power switch. While emergency sanding remains active for the duration of a sanding timer, the power control PCS remains active as long as the conventional emergency state remains active. The emergency state remains active until the emergency state timer has expired and the automatic brake lever of the air brake system has been returned to the emergency state position for resetting. To explain the integration of the distributive power system into the ECP system, and since the detection of an emergency event in the DP controlled unit is more complicated, this will be explained first. Although the integrative architecture of the6By way of example, others may be used. 6describes the information transfer requirements for processing a pneumatic emergency event on a DP controlled unit. When a local conventional emergency condition becomes active on a DP controlled unit, it issues an emergency braking request to the leading DP unit. The emergency or emergency brake request remains active until the DP controlled unit receives an appropriate DP emergency brake response from the leading DP unit. Referring to6the sequences are indicated by arrows with numbers. The sequence1starts at arrow1wherein the conventional air brake emergency braking condition is achieved at the DP control unit. This is provided by the electropneumatic control unit20detected. The brake line charge is interrupted and by the IPM27the PCS is set, the emergency state timer is initiated and the time slave for emergency sandblasting is initiated locally. The status is also passed through the ECP function to the controlling remote DP function. The ECP function can also create an ECP trainline emergency condition resulting from an emergency electrical condition. In the second step of the process, arrow2, the status of the DP-controlled unit is transferred to the leading DP unit. This is an emergency condition request and may request an ECP trainline emergency status request or pneumatic trainline emergency status via the trainline40be. This takes place in the form of a DP status message and / or a DP exception message. In the next step, arrow3, the leading DP unit via the leading DP function requests an ECP emergency brake application from the EPC (HEU) function to create a train-wide emergency brake actuation, arrow4, The ECP train brake command on the EP line40is received by every ECP-equipped wagon and train locomotives. As a result, the ECP functions on the leading DP unit and the DP controlled unit locally command an equivalent brake cylinder pressure. The ECP function (HEU) also transmits the EPC emergency brake command back to the leading DP function, illustrated by arrow5, and set the leading PCS and enter the EPC Emergency state, as indicated by arrow6displayed. Upon receipt of a pneumatic trainline emergency condition request via the arrow2from the controlling, remote DP function and receipt of an ECP emergency status command via arrow5from the ECP (HEU) function, the leading DP function transmits an inbound DP emergency status command on the EP trainline40, indicated by arrow7, The DP commands are received by the controlling remote DP function and by the ECP function via arrow8thdirected to the conventional air brake system to put it in an electropneumatic emergency condition, and via arrow9to the PCS controller and the EMC controller. These DP commands include ECP Emergency, Pneumatic Emergency, and PCS. If the DP controlled unit the ECP and DP emergency status commands from the leading one DP function and the local emergency event ends (this can be the removal of the emergency state function or the aspiration the emergency state timer), the conventional state of emergency be released. This releases the local PCS command and the ECP and pneumatic emergency request to the leading unit will be removed. At this point, the DP controlled unit only follows the ECP guidance commands, and the DP command commands are also routed locally to the ECP (HEU), and the local air brake system for emergency status control, PCS control and EBV control. Consequently the event that was captured remotely is replicated to the lead. The release of the local conventional air brake emergency condition is returned to the controlling remote DP function by the ECP function as indicated by the arrows10illustrated. The controlling, remote DP function then gives an earlier set ECP and pneumatic trainline emergency status request status on the EP trainline40free to the leading DP function as indicated by arrow11indicated. The leading DP function removes the emergency status request to the ECP function (HEU) as indicated by arrow12is displayed and waits for the ECP (HEU) function to clear the next emergency state. The leading DP unit issues trainline commands to the DP controlled unit as indicated by arrow13is displayed to indicate that there is no pneumatic emergency, no ECP emergency enforcement, and no trainline PCS. The ECP function (HEU) returns control to the operator or handle. The DP controlled unit deactivates DMV in response to the trainline commands, removes the PCS, and sets the brake pipe load via the ECP function as indicated by arrow14displayed again. The same function is performed on the leading DP unit as indicated by arrow15illustrated. The electromagnetic valve EMC is used only in the pneumatic or Operator-initiated emergency conditions activated. The operator-initiated emergency states move in this context the auxiliary handle in the emergency position to a pneumatic emergency condition to accomplish. If the emergency status event is local to the leading DP unit, the ECP (HEU) function transmits the train brake command on the EP line40, indicated by arrow4, and transmits an ECP emergency status command back to the by arrow5displayed leading DP function. The operation then continues for a remotely located emergency event to cause emergency conditions on the leading DP unit and all DP controlled units. The release of the emergency condition event, including the timing of the timer, occurs at the leading DP unit which is routed locally through the ECP function as well as remotely through the leading DP function, as indicated by arrow13displayed. The control27.26provides penalty brake commands as in7shown. For these penalty brake commands in electric control mode, penalty brake command signals are sent to the TCC control42given to transmit a wagon brake signal on the network for penalty brake commands. Penalty braking is generally a full service brake command. As with other wagon brake signals in the network, the brake line remains21loaded. A penalty confirmation from the TCC42to the IPM27is required. If it is not received, the IPM commands27a pneumatic emergency application using the EP control unit20, The control27Also determines whether the suppression brake command has taken place to remove or prevent the operation of a penalty brake. This is the suppression position of the automatic brake handle of the electric brake valve26, If the suppression brake commands occur during a penalty brake command, control sends27.26no control or brake command signals to the controller42or removes and interrupts any penalty application that controls42on the EP train line40provides. As is well known, the controller gives27.26a power down signal to the locomotive propulsion system for penalty brake commands. In older systems, the movement of the automatic brake handle to the suppression position causes a brake pipe shortening which operates the train brakes. This is undesirable and avoided by the present system which uses the suppression position only as an electrical control signal and in the brake line21No pneumatic results produced. As can be seen, the brake pipe in an ECP train is primarily an air supply and is not used for brake control. In the current system, the brake pipe21used as a backup to allow pneumatic operation of train brakes as well as operator and pneumatic system initiated emergency conditions. For future acceptance of ECP brakes by the industry have the train brake line21and the locomotive lines22and23possibly no control functions. In an EP-only train are the independent locomotive brake lines22and the actuation locomotive line23eliminated. All signals are transmitted via the EP trainline40sent out. Consequently, trainline brake signals are addressed separately to wagons and locomotives, and special locomotive brake signals are addressed only to locomotives. It should also be noted in the present system - even in those who use the independent brake line22with or without the control line23- that those locomotives that have EP brakes, preferably their brake signal via the electric brake line40receive. The locomotives, which have no EP brakes, receive the signals pneumatically via the independent or locomotive brake line22, The locomotives that are not adjacent to the leading locomotive and not by the independent brake line22are connected to other locomotives, receive their signal either by radio33or the remote locomotive can have EP capability and their signals on the EP trainline40receive. It can then pneumatically control other contiguous locomotives in its composite, if through an independent line22are connected. Another example of a remote locomotive would be a sliding locomotive attached at the end of the train when needed to handle a particular grade. These locomotives would be EP-equipped and would use their locomotive brake signals from the EP train line40to take. This would include automatic, independent and bail-off release commands. The brake control27is started in conventional or pneumatic mode. In order to be switched to electric mode, it must be selected as the leading locomotive and then switched to electrical mode. The integration or coordination of the electrically controlled pneumatics or the ECP system by the computer-controlled braking system makes it possible to increase safety. The computer-controlled braking system can determine whether the electrically controlled pneumatics42in operation or not, and if not, the pneumatic control of the brake line21provide braking power throughout the train. By providing a single brake control valve26and a single display32In addition, the operator in a state of emergency does not need to decide whether to switch from electrical control to pneumatic control. The operator uses a simple handle and a simple display and selects whether pneumatic or electrical control is used. When the electrically controlled brakes are not in operation, the system automatically switches to the pneumatic control without additional input from the operator. As a result, integration not only increases the reliability of the two systems, but also substantially eliminates operator error. Though the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, but it is emphatic to point out that this is for illustrative and example purposes only done and no restrictions can be derived from it. The scope of the present invention can only be limited by the terms of the appended claims."

167,NL-1015151-C2,Device and method for cataloging textual information. ,2000,"Device and method for cataloging textual information The invention relates to a method for cataloging, or searching in, textual information, as well as a device therefor. Such a method is generally known. For example, it is known to catalog textual information by means of so-called ""natural language processing"". The interrelation between words is analyzed on the basis of applicable grammar rules, and in this way connections between words that together form concepts 10 are recognized. However, such an analysis takes a lot of computing time, is complex and is language dependent. In addition, methods are known in which all words, with the exception of stop words, are indexed individually. However, a great deal of information is lost in this process, especially with regard to terms composed of several words. Other known methods, such as described in US-5,931,907, US-5,754,938, EP-A-860,785 or WO-A-OO / 17781, among others, use keywords. The disadvantage of this is that the use of wrong keywords in the search can lead to missing information. In addition, a keyword can be used in, for example, a document that has nothing to do with searched documents. For example, the use of the 101 51 51 2 keyword ""xenotransplantation"" in search may result in missing references using the word ""xenographic procedure"". In addition, truncation to the search term ""xeno"" can lead to far too many irrelevant hits. Still other known methods, such as described in WO-A-98/38560, among others, use automatically generated word clusters and terms. in such methods, the editing of many texts recognizes coherence and relationships between words. When 10 certain words often occur together, these words can be recognized as belonging to one concept. The known methods are therefore either too slow or too inaccurate, for instance to be applied interactively and possibly by an inexperienced user. It is an object of the invention to provide a method of the type mentioned in the preamble, which is suitable, inter alia, for interactive application, for application by an inexperienced user, or for application in a distributed environment, such as for instance the internet or an intranet. These goals are achieved, and other advantages are achieved, with a method of cataloging textual information or generating a knowledge profile therefrom, wherein: a user enters textual information into a computer, further provided with software; The software includes a routine that divides the textual information into words, and a routine that searches the words of the textual information in at least one structured data file contained in memory means in the computer, which structured data file comprises words containing per word references to 3 5 concepts; the software is provided with a routine that searches word by word in the textual information for all corresponding words in the structured data file and subsequently links the related concepts from the structured data file per word; 5 and the software is provided with a routine which then clusters concepts into a list of keywords or umbrella keywords by means of clustering; and the software is provided with a routine 10 which subsequently presents the list of keywords to the user in interactive as a knowledge profile or category. The invention further relates to a computer system provided with input means, output means and connection means for connection to other computer systems, wherein the computer system is arranged for carrying out the method according to one or more of the preceding claims. Because the method according to the invention uses structured data files in the cataloging, it is possible to catalog textual information in a fast, efficient manner, which is possibly suitable for interactive application by an inexperienced user, for instance via a distributed environment such as the internet or an intranet. Cataloging according to the invention includes indexing textual information and making textual information findable. For example, the terms or keywords associated with the textual information may be abstract representations of multiple words. An example of this is the International Patent Classification System (IPC), in which terms, often several words long, are indicated using a code. In one embodiment of the present invention, the terms in the structured data file refer to keywords, with the routine clustering the keywords then clustering the keywords. In addition, several terms in the structured data file can refer to the same keyword. A term can also refer to several keywords. Preferably, the structured data file is a structured glossary such as a thesaurus or metathesaurus. In the further text, when the word thesaurus is used, implicitly also metathesaurus is meant. In treasury, concepts are arranged according to a hierarchical system of umbrella or generic concepts, including increasingly specific concepts. This creates a kind of tree structure of higher-level, overarching concepts, with branches to increasingly specific concepts. In the method according to the invention, if desired, use can be made of treasury from different knowledge areas and this treasury can be combined into one large thesaurus. Clustering preferably takes place on the basis of connections within sentences. This makes a very fast method possible, while experiments have shown that very good accuracy was nevertheless achieved. Clustering searches for common concepts, and possibly corresponding umbrella concepts to which words in a sentence refer back. 25 This is repeated until no more common concepts are found. In order to determine which terms in the list of terms are to be shown to a user, all terms in the list of terms are provided with weights which indicate the mutual importance. Preferably, the weights include quantities relating to the frequency with which the terms occur in the textual information, the specificity of the terms and a measure of the certainty of the occurrence of the term (i.e. the sensitivity) in the textual information. The weights represent statistical properties of each concept. This includes the specificity, the 101 51 51 5 sensitivity, the number of alternatives that appear in the textual information and the textual simularity. On the basis of the weights, it can be determined, for example, which terms are shown to the user from the list of terms. In order to increase the accuracy even further, it is preferable if the user can interactively adjust the weights, specifically the relative weights of the terms shown to each other. In order to make the textual information easily searchable, the list of terms per concept includes information with regard to the location of the textual information. As a result, the list of terms with the location can be included in a database, and the textual information can easily be retrieved. Moreover, by including references, it is not necessary to include the complete textual information. Preferably, the information related to the location is a hyperlink. This creates a distributed data file, whereby the textual information can even be distributed over many different computers. The invention further relates to a method for building and maintaining knowledge and / or interest networks, in which textual information is cataloged according to the method for cataloging textual information as described above, and wherein the list of terms is linked to information identifying the user, preferably a hyperlink or e-mail address. In addition, the invention relates to a method for searching textual data files, wherein textual input is cataloged according to the method for cataloging textual information as described above, after which a position is searched in the textual data file that is statistically is most consistent with the list of terms. 101 51 51 6 The method according to the invention proves to be very suitable for use in interactive environments and interactive applications, and in particular for interactive inter or intranet applications. For interactive 5 applications, and. even more specific for internet and intranet applications, for example, the speed and amount of data that different computers, such as a server and a user, must exchange with each other to achieve a desired result is important. It is possible for a user to edit a second piece of textual information after analyzing a first part of textual information. The two lists that then arise are then combined into one list by combining the terms in the lists based on the weights. A possible application for which the method according to the invention is particularly suitable is the interactive building and maintenance of knowledge and / or interest networks, in particular via the internet or the internet. In addition, software for carrying out the method according to the invention is present on a server. A user can access the software on the server. After entering personal data, the user is enabled to transfer selected textual files to the server. These can be files of his own hand, such as a curriculum vitae, but better still a longer text, such as reports, a thesis, a dissertation, articles or the like. In that case a knowledge profile is created. The textual files can also be articles that represent the user's area of interest. In that case it is an interest profile. By now storing the interest profiles or knowledge profiles of many people and making them searchable, for example by storage in a database, a knowledge or interest network is created. On the server, the software indexes the 101 51 51 7 textual information according to the method according to the invention and presents a list of terms to the user. The user is then enabled to edit the list, for example by changing the assigned 5 weights per concept. This can be done in various interactive ways. For example, spider web diagrams can be used. The various concepts are arranged radially around a common center. By now dragging a term along the radial axis 10, for example using input means such as a mouse, keys, a trackball, a touch pad or the like, the relative weight of a selected term can be changed. Another possibility is to plot the terms on a bar chart, and to enable the user to set the length of the different bars by means of the input means already mentioned. The user can then save the list of terms and connections with his textual information locally on his own computer or on the server. The list can optionally be added and added to a larger database with data from other users. A user can also search the database using the list of terms and their weights. This search can be done interactively. The user sees, for example, the number of hits. By interactively changing the weight of the different terms, for example in a manner as indicated above, the user immediately sees the number of hits change. A specific embodiment of the invention will be further elucidated with reference to the figures. The figures serve to illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention, and are not to be construed as or limitation thereto. Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of a specific embodiment of the method according to the invention. 101 51 51 8 Figure 2 shows the relationship between user identification data. Figure 3 shows a possible way of building up a knowledge and / or interest network. Figure 1 shows an example of implementation of the method according to the invention. This enters a text fragment, or an entire article, or a series of articles (1). This can be done, for example • by highlighting text parts or selecting text files on the user's computer by the user by means of input means such as the mouse, and dragging the selected text files or marked text parts to an input screen that is displayed by the software on the user's computer. server is displayed on the user's computer screen. The text fragment or text file, the textual information, is then first normalized (2). Here stop words are removed (3), and words are reduced to their root (""stem-20 ming"" in English). This creates a list (4) of normalized words. This list is then compared (5) with terms in a thesaurus or a metathesaurus (6). By using one of the thesaurus or metathesaurus derived alphabetical list words from the the-25 saurus or metathesaurus that have been reduced to their root, a tribal wordlist made it possible to make the comparison very quickly. Preferably, the root words are arranged in an n-ary tree to enable quick search of the root words in the root word list with each word in the list of normalized words. Every word in the list of normalized words searches for all possible thesaurus concepts. In this way a list (7) is produced with for each word of the textual information all possible thesaurus concepts. Words that do not appear in the thesaurus are omitted. The results are then analyzed (8). It is checked, for each 101 51 51. 9 word per sentence, whether there is a connection with another word in the sentence, i.e. whether two or more words together form part of a term that occurs in the thesaurus or metathesaurus. Parent thesaurus concepts 5 are also searched for and, if several child concepts refer to the same parent concept, replaced by the parent concept. This process is called clustering. The clustering is the search for common concepts that are referred back to by adjoining words in the textual information. The clustering is also applied to found clusters, until no common concepts are found. If desired, clustered within sentences. That is to say whether common concepts are used. This can be repeated until no more change occurs. After that it is possible to cluster based on adjacent sentences. It can then be analyzed whether concepts exist that are a specius of the same parent concept, i.e. have a common genus. In that case the genus can be used. If necessary, this can only be done for the concepts presented to the user. Every concept found is given a weight. This weight is composed, among other things, of a value that indicates where a concept is located on the scale from specific to general. These values have been given to the concepts in the thesaurus beforehand. In addition, the weight is composed of the frequency with which the term occurs in the textual information. The weight is further composed of a probability number which indicates how certain the software is that the concept corresponds to the words in the textual information. On the basis of the weights it is determined which terms are presented to the user in the list of terms. The selection criterion for this is adjustable. A list of suggested terms (9) is then presented to the user. The user 101 51 51 10 is then able to edit the list interactively (10). The user can then return the modified list (11). In the adapted list a connection (12) is included but the original textual information, in the form of a hyperlink to the text, possibly on another computer, an address or e-mail address of the user, or on a other way. Preferably, however, a connection to the textual information on another computer. As a result, not much data has to be stored on the server 10. As a result, a relatively light server is sufficient, whereby the computer system according to the invention can be lightly constructed. The method according to the invention can be used in a very advantageous manner for the development, maintenance and building up of knowledge and interest networks of persons within organizations, of organizations themselves and / or of persons themselves. Figures 2 and 3 relate to this. To build and maintain such a network, knowledge and interest profiles of 20 people and organizations must be generated and connected to each other. The method according to the invention can support and implement this. Figure 2 schematically shows which information items must be entered for this purpose, and what the interrelationships between the different information items are. For example, it is possible to include information about persons (20) such as the name, the organization with which they work, an e-mail address and other information. In addition, information about the organization (21) can be included, such as contact details, but also an interest or knowledge profile (22). This profile can be generated using the method according to the invention. In addition or instead, a knowledge or interest profile of the person (23) may be included, 35 with links to textual information (24). This interest or knowledge profile can be generated using the method according to the invention. 101 51 51 11 Figure 3 shows a possibility on which a method for building and maintaining a knowledge network according to the invention can be implemented. A user (31) firstly enters textual information (sources) which, according to the user, relate to his expertise, such as articles and reports written by him, or his interest, such as articles directly related to the area of interest. This textual information is processed according to the method according to the invention, for instance according to the scheme of figure 1. From this processing follows a knowledge or interest profile, linked to the user data and to the sources. The user adjusts the profile interactively (32). The profile is then placed in a queue (33). An authorization unit (34), either an automated system or a person, checks the data and profile for completeness and performs a validation before entering the data and profile in a database, i.e. a database (35). When entering 20 into the database, the user receives a .confirmation message (36). The database can be consulted by users. 101 51 51"

In particular, with existing target guidance devices exactly determinable parameters when calculating the Travel time not taken into account at all or only insufficiently. Such parameters are, for example, the influence of the route ke - for example a dry, wet, smooth road -, the driving style of the respective driver, the day time, the outside temperature, visibility, etc. This different influences undoubtedly lead to strong ones Fluctuations in actual travel time, however, with known travel time calculation algorithms not at all be taken into account. The present invention is therefore based on the object a method and a navigation system with destination guidance direction to indicate a more precise determination of the journey allow time. According to the invention, the process-related task is achieved by a Method with the features of claim 1 solved. Accordingly, a generic method is provided that is characterized in that in the memory unit perso NEN-related data are saved, which for the respective Drivers can be identified on different types of roads. The system-related object is achieved by a navigation system with the features of claim 4 ge solves. Accordingly, a navigation system for a motor vehicle is provided, - With a processing device for controlling the navigation system gationssystems, - With a map information storage device for storage saving card data, - With an instantaneous position detection device for identification tify the current position of the moving force vehicle with the help of the in the map information Storage device stored map data, - With a target guidance device that calculates a travel time algorithm for calculating the travel time, and - With an output device for displaying the travel time determined by the destination guidance device, wherein personal data can be stored in the storage unit (52), which are determined for the respective driver when driving on different road types. In this way, an intelligent Ver drive to calculate the journey time and thus the determination the arrival time for destination guidance devices. This method, in addition to the calculation algorithms the system-known fixed parameters also adaptive, people related parameters are clearly pre ciser and more reliable in the calculation of the travel time or Arrival time of the motor vehicle. Further advantageous refinements and developments of Inventions are the dependent claims and the following Be removable spelling. The invention is described below with reference to the single figure of the Drawing explained in more detail. The figure shows a block circuit Image of a navigation system with an inventive Destination guide. InFig.1, 1 denotes a navigation system for motor vehicles. The navigation system1has a processing device2. The processing device2is connected to a map information storage device3, a current position detection device4and a target guide device5. In the map information storage device3, map data such as road guides, road numbers or the like are stored. But not necessarily - - Momentanposition- the detection means4comprises for identifying the economic refreshes current position of a motor vehicle typically includes a GPS receiver41,a direction sensor42,and a distance sensor43rdThe destination guidance device5is connected on the input side to the instantaneous position detection device4and the map information storage device3and on the output side to the processing device2. The destination guidance device5is used to calculate the travel time and for this purpose contains at least one computing unit51and one storage unit52. The processing device2has means for processing the position data and the target guidance data and for controlling the navigation system. For this purpose, the processing device2typically has a program-controlled unit21(CPU), a read / write memory22(RAM) for intermediate storage of the determined data, a read-only memory23(ROM) for receiving the command codes, a display control unit24and an input - / output unit25(I / O unit). The processing device2is also connected to an output device6- for example a display - by means of which the data determined by the processing device2 aretransmitted to the motor vehicle user in a suitable manner. In addition, the processing device2 canalso be connected to an input device7- for example a keyboard - via which a motor vehicle user can enter data, such as a personal driver profile, a desired route guidance, the travel time, etc. The target guidance device5can advantageously also be part of the processing device2(not shown in the figure). In this case, the function of its computing unit51and storage unit52could, for example, be at least partially formed by the central computing unit21or the storage devices22,23 ofthe processing device2. The method according to the invention is described below with reference to the figure:In a navigation system1, the position data determined by the momentary position detection device4can be processed with the map data of the map data storage device3 insuch a way that the motor vehicle user always receives the exact position of the vehicle via a display device6. The time required for the journey can be estimated from the exact position of the motor vehicle and the desired destination by calculating the journey time using a suitable calculation algorithm. This calculation algorithm is typically based on fixed parameters. According to the invention, this calculation algorithm is now expanded to include additional adaptive parameters for calculating the travel time. In the simplest form, the storage unit52stores the average speed achieved by the motor vehicle for the various types of road. When driving on such a road type again, the destination guiding device5can use the previously gained knowledge - in this case the stored average speed - to calculate the travel time. This procedure is further refined by storing the data obtained not only in relation to the type of road but in relation to individual road sections. Since the navigation system1provides for personalization of different motor vehicle users, the data obtained is advantageously also stored in a personal manner. Further improvements in the accuracy of the travel time calculation result from the inclusion of further parameters, such as the time of day, the outside temperature, the visibility, the road conditions, wetness, smoothness, the traffic density, congestion, etc. By including off-board information - for example from an RDS / TMC service or telematics service - can In formations also collected externally from traffic reports and used sensibly. The state of various Roads - for example construction sites - which are a permanent ver represent traffic disabilities can be obtained via databases become. The data determined in this way is therefore a very exact one  Calculation of the travel time, especially by the Einbe drawing a special driver profile, possible. It is also particularly advantageous if the target guidance device5 isequipped with a trained neural network for the purpose of reducing the computing power. Such trained neural networks are particularly advantageous when the calculation algorithms on which the calculation is based are extremely complex or are not known at all. These complex, often non-linear equations can be comparatively easily calculated using neural networks. It should also be noted that a navigation system1 designed ina typical manner is shown in the figure. Of course, the method according to the invention can be used equally advantageously in navigation systems1for motor vehicles which are designed in any manner.

221,NL-1014658-C2,Speedometer. ,2000,"SPEEDOMETER The invention relates to a device for determining speed and distance traveled by measuring successive step movements of an object. Measuring the speed of an object making a stepping movement, for example a runner, is relatively complicated. It is necessary to measure the displacement of the object relative to the earth. Since there are no parts of the object that are in constant contact with the earth, it is not possible to measure the speed and the distance traveled with conventional measuring methods, such as those used in cars, for example. Systems are known for measuring the velocity of an object making a stepping movement, comprising measuring means for measuring the accelerations in three main directions and the angles at which these measuring means are located with respect to the earth. Such a device is for instance known from US-A-5 899 963. The angular velocities can be measured by means of gyroscopes from which the angles can be derived by integration. The calculated angles and measured accelerations can then be used to calculate the speed and the distance traveled by integration. However, the drawback of such a device is that gyroscopes 25 are relatively heavy and large and require a lot of energy, so that the use of such a device is not suitable for, for example, runners. In addition, the measuring means are relatively expensive, so that these systems are not suitable for sale to a large audience. US-A-5 955 667 describes a simpler measuring device, in which the acceleration is measured in two directions and furthermore only one angle is measured with the aid of an angle sensor which has the above-mentioned drawbacks. Furthermore, the measuring device must be placed on a shoe, for example, in such a way that the first gear measuring direction is the running direction and the second gear measuring direction is oriented perpendicularly upwards. Then the angle sensor measures the angle at which the shoe is located. It is therefore assumed that the shoe moves in a vertical plane during the stepping movement. This is in no way the case during the walking movement of a person. Everyone has their own walking movement, in which the foot moves in all directions and rotates in different directions. Such a device has a measurement error depending on the person and thus only gives estimates of the speed and the distance traveled. WO-A-99 44016 describes a very simplified measuring device, which contains only one accelerometer. The measured signal is integrated in order to obtain an indication of the forward speed. This indication is converted into a speed by means of an empirically determined factor. This speed is an indication of the speed of the object, but will contain a significant error, for example if the accelerometer is not in the plane of the movement or if the stepping movement is different from the stepping movement on the basis of which the empirical factor has been determined . It is an object of the invention to provide a measuring device which does not have all or part of the above-mentioned drawbacks. This object is achieved according to the invention by a device comprising: - measuring means for measuring the acceleration of the object during a stepping movement in two main directions; - processing means for determining the speed from the measured accelerations, the processing means being arranged in such a way that the measured accelerations are integrated on the basis of an orientation course to a speed and, if necessary, determination of the distance traveled; - means for displaying the speed calculated by the processing means and possibly the distance traveled. The major directions do not necessarily have to be perpendicular to each other, but when measuring two directions they must not be aligned and when measuring three directions they must not be in one plane. By assuming a standard orientation course of the object, it becomes possible to transform the accelerations of the object in the principal directions to the accelerations of the object with respect to the earth. This makes it possible to determine the speed of the object and thus also the distance traveled. After measuring the stepping movement, it can be determined on the basis of a number of criteria whether the chosen orientation course was correct, or whether an adjusted orientation course must be taken in order to achieve a higher accuracy. By continuously improving the course of the orientation, the measuring error is minimized and 25 changing running conditions are also taken into account. In an embodiment according to the invention, the orientation course is adjusted by selecting an orientation course from calculations from a table. For example, when the device is used for runners, the different speeds can be listed in a table and the corresponding orientations of the foot during running. In addition, the style of walking can also be important for making a better choice. In another embodiment of the invention, the adjustment of the orientation course takes place by changing parts of the orientation course on the basis of the calculations. For example, by the iü ïJ H C 'O O By applying an expert system, fuzzy logic or a neural network, it becomes possible to adjust the standard course of orientation chosen in a relatively intelligent way. A smart choice from a table can also be made with such an intelligent system. This makes it possible to fully adjust the orientation course to the runner and thus minimize the measurement error. In yet another embodiment according to the invention, the standard orientation course can be selected depending on the accelerations measured during the previous step movement. During the previous step movement, a rough estimate can be made of, for example, the speed or the running style, on the basis of 15 specific peaks and troughs in the measured accelerations, whereby a certain orientation course is then chosen. This shortens the iteration procedure to arrive at the smallest possible measurement error, which means that the minimum measurement error is measured earlier during a trajectory. According to the invention, the criteria to be chosen for adjusting the orientation course can comprise the deviations between predetermined boundary conditions and calculated values. The speed 25 is calculated on the basis of the accelerations and the course of the orientation. At the end of the step, the resulting speed vector and the average speed across the running direction should be zero again. If this is not the case, the orientation course must be adjusted. In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the processing means are arranged such that, in a rest position, the orientation of two of the three main directions with respect to gravity is determined. With accelerometers, which can also measure gravity 35, it is possible to determine how the device is positioned relative to gravity in the rest position. This makes it possible to place the device on the shoe in any desired position. 1014658 5 In addition, when three main directions are measured, the processing means are further arranged such that after a stepping movement the orientation of the three main directions relative to the resulting velocity vector is determined. Together with the orientation with respect to gravity, it is thus possible to determine how the three main directions are oriented with respect to the walking direction. This shortens the iteration process to arrive at a good orientation course and a minimal error. This also makes it possible to place the device on the shoe in any desired position. In order to be able to determine the start and end of the stepping movement, it is of course possible to provide a pressure switch in the contact surface, between object and earth, but according to a preferred embodiment of the invention the processing means are arranged such that of the measured accelerations the end of a stepping movement 20 is determined. When the object hits the ground, the shock will cause the measured accelerations to deviate significantly from the accelerations during the stride, making it possible to determine when the stride is complete. With the step duration found, it is possible to predict the next step and this next step only needs to be checked. In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, display means are housed in a wristwatch, so that a runner can easily see his speed and, for example, the distance traveled. Other functions can of course also be accommodated in this watch, such as a stopwatch and time indication. Preferably, the display means 35 are wirelessly connected to the processing means and / or the measuring means are wirelessly connected to the processing means. ; i 014 S 5 8 6 These and other features according to the invention are further elucidated with reference to the annexed drawings. Figure 1 shows a runner wearing the device 5 according to the invention. Figure 2 shows the foot of the runner according to Figure 1. Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of an embodiment according to the invention. Figure 4 schematically shows a component of figure 3 in more detail. Figure 5 shows a flow chart of an embodiment according to the invention. Figure 1 shows a runner L carrying a device 1 on a 15 foot V. Furthermore, the runner L has a watch 2 on his wrist, on which he can read the calculated values of the device 1. The data from the device 1 is transmitted wirelessly to the wrist watch 2. 20 The foot V is shown in more detail in figure 2. Device 1 is placed on the instep. The device 1 can of course also be placed elsewhere on the foot. Furthermore, the three main directions in which the device 1 measures are shown. These principal directions X, Y, Z are rotated relative to the foot V. The device 1 is schematically shown in figure 3. The device 1 comprises three acceleration sensors 3, each measuring the accelerations in a main direction X, Y, Z. The measured gears are then fed to a processing unit 4, which performs calculations on the basis of these gears and then passes calculated values to the wrist watch 2. The processing unit can be mounted on the shoe, in the watch or in another place. Figure 4 shows in more detail how a part of the processing unit 4 can work in a preferred embodiment. The three measured accelerations X, Y, Z are collected and shown as a graph 5 for clarification, in which the accelerations of one step are shown as a function of time. The gears are passed on to a calculator 6, where these gears 5 are integrated. The gears are also passed on to a look-up table 7, where a standard orientation course 8 is selected. This orientation course is shown as a graph 9 and is also passed on to the calculation unit 6. This angular course is necessary to be able to transform the three main directions X, Y, Z into a coordinate system, with gravity being one of the main directions and the walking direction (or sagital direction) being another. Integration is then carried out, subtracting gravity from the measured accelerations, if absolute accelerometers are used. After the integration by the computing unit 6, a one-step speed progression is obtained. This course of speed or an operation thereof, such as average speed or distance, can be passed on to the wristwatch. If the resulting velocity at the end of the step, at the reference numeral 11 in the graph 10, is not zero, then by feedback to the look-up table 7, the default 25 orientation course must be adjusted until the error is minimal, that ie below a threshold value. Even if the average speed transverse to the running direction is not zero, the orientation course must be adjusted. The calculated velocity profile 10 can be averaged in order to calculate an average speed of the step or can be integrated again in order to be able to calculate the step length. The consecutive step lengths can then be summed to calculate the distance traveled. Speed and distance traveled can be passed to the display, as well as parameters such as the number of steps per minute (the frequency), 1014658 8 countdown distance and the minimum and maximum speed achieved. Figure 5 shows a flow chart of an embodiment according to the invention. The measuring cycle is started at block 21 5. First of all, it is determined at 22 whether the user is stationary. If this is not the case, it is determined at 23 whether a periodic signal has previously been found. If this is the case, at 24 the periodicity found will be checked with 10 the expectation and, if necessary, minor adjustments will be made in the duration of the step. If it is found that the user is stationary at 22, then the inclination of the sensor relative to gravity will be determined at 25 and two main directions will be recorded. Then at 26 it is determined whether the user is stationary. If this is the case, the inclination of the sensor will again be determined at 25. If the user is not standing still, then at 27 the periodicity in the acceleration signal will be determined. The beginning and the duration of the first step are thus looked up. After this, or after the operations of 24 have been performed, it is determined whether the found start and duration values are within the expected range 25. If not, the periodicity in the acceleration signal will again be determined at 27. However, if the values for the start and duration of the step are OK, the angle that the sensor makes with the running direction is determined at 29. 30 Next, at 30, the measured one-step accelerations are transformed to the Earth's coordinate system using the orientation course. Then, at 31, the gears in the Earth's system are numerically integrated. After integration, it is determined at 33 whether the calculated speed curve corresponds to the given boundary conditions, such as the condition that at the end of the step the resulting speed is zero and the average speeds are 1 014 6 58 9 transverse to the running direction. If not, at 32 the orientation course will be adjusted using a table or expert system, fuzzy logic, or neural network. 5 If at 33 the given boundary conditions are met, the average speed of the step is calculated and the next step can be measured and calculated. .1 01465 «"

244,DE-60128029-T2,Apparatus and method for detecting or recognizing patterns by means of a plurality of feature detection elements ,2000,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention The The invention relates to a device and a method mainly for Recognizing a pattern or recognizing a particular object by using a parallel arithmetic device, such as For example, a neural network, are configured. Description of the relative State of the art So far were in the field of image recognition or speech recognition the methods available to implement such recognition roughly classified into two types. With one kind becomes such a recognition by performing a serial arithmetic operation by using, as a Computer software program, a recognition processing algorithm, which is tailored to a particular object to be recognized, implemented. In the other type, such a detection is under Using a dedicated parallel image processor, such as a Single Instruction Multiple Data Stream (SIMD) machine or a multi-instruction multiple data stream (MIMD) machine, implemented. The following will be typical examples of image recognition algorithms describe. First include examples in which a feature size in terms of similarity to a recognized Is calculated, a method in which the to be recognized Model-related data in the form of a template model and the similarity based on a match or the like between an input image (or the feature vector same) and the template, or a correlation coefficient high order, a method in which an input pattern is mapped to an eigen-image function space by performing the Main component analysis of a model image of an object obtained was used to calculate the distance to the model in a feature space (Sirovich, et al., 1987, Low-dimensional procedure for the characterization of human faces, J. Opt. Soc. At the. [A], Vol. 3, pp. 519-524) Method in which the relationship between a plurality of feature extraction results (Feature vectors) and the spatial Arrangements thereof are shown in a graph to the similarity based on an elastic graph match (Lades et al., 1993, Distortion Invariant Object Recognition in the Dynamic Link Architecture, IEEE Trans. On Computers, Vol. 42, Pages 300-311), and a method in which an input image of a predetermined Transformation is subjected to an expression with position, rotation, and scale immutability then tested against a model (Seibert, et al., 1992, Learning and recognizing 3D objects from multiple views in a neural System, in Neural Networks for Perception, Vol. 1, Human and Machine Perception (H. Wechsler Ed.), Academic Press, pp. 427-444). method for recognizing a pattern based on a neural network model, that from a key based on an information processing mechanism of a living Organism was obtained, involve a method based on a hierarchical template match (Japanese tested Patent publication No. 60-712, Fukushima & Miyake, 1982, Neocognitron: A new algorithm for pattern recognition tolerant of deformation and shifts in position, Pattern Recognition, Vol. 15, pages 455-469), a method in which an object-centered expression with scale and position invariance through a dynamically routing neural network is obtained (Anderson, et al., 1995, Routing Networks in Visual Cortex, in Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks (M.Arbib, Ed.), MIT Press, pp. 823-826), and a method based on a multi-layer perceptron and a Radial basis function network. When an attempt to faithfully model the information processing mechanism based on the neural network of a living organism have been neural network model circuits to perform a transmission representation using a train of pulses corresponding to action potentials (Murray, et al., 1991, Pulse-Stream VLSI Neural Networks Mixing Analog and Digital Techniques, IEEE Trans. On Neural Networks, Vol. 2, pages 193-204; Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 7-262157, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 7-334478, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-153148, Patent Gazette No. 2879670, etc.). In implementing the above-mentioned prior art using circuits or the like, particularly with regard to the application to image recognition, there have been no methods for representing information regarding a two-dimensional pattern by using one  Dynamic characteristic on a time base, and using the represented information for detection or the like at any level of a processing device, a module, or a system available, which forms a function of each processing unit (for example, the extraction of a feature). More accurate expressed has been in many cases assumed that the processing based on a transitional pattern which consists of a finite number of states (predominantly composed of firing and non-firing) to a particular Time of a processing element or module in which spatial Pattern information spatially have been arranged. About that addition, the application was for processing in an area of digital representation limited to information. Out The reason described above was the information processing capability limited, and the implementation tends in the form of circuits to an excessive size and high Costs to bring. In particular, the proportion of a large number of wiring for the connection between neurons in the whole area considerably high, so this has presented a problem. Therefore was as a solution the wiring problem in neural networks a method proposed in which the addresses of pulse output neurons in an event-driven manner, acting as an address event representation (hereinafter referred to as ""AER""; Address Event Representation) is known (Lazarro, et al., 1993, Silicon Auditory Processors as Computer Peripherals, in Tourestzky, D. (ed), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 5. San Mateo, CA: Morgan Merchant Publishers). In accordance With this method, the identities or IDs of the pulse trains emitting neurons in a binary one Mode encoded as addresses to the neuron that addresses to welcome, the addresses of the origin neurons as well then automatically decode if the output signals from different Neurons are arranged temporally on the same bus. The However, AER showed a problem in that a facility for sequentially encoding and decoding the addresses of neurons is required, which complicates a circuit configuration. It another method is available for recognizing or detecting a particular object by means of a from neurons, the pulse trains generate, formed neural network. This method uses a model of a higher Order (a second order or higher) from Eckhorn, et al., The on a link of entrances and supplying entrances (Eckhorn, et al., 1990, Feature linking via synchronization among distributed assemblies: Simulation of results from cat cortex, Neural Computation, Vol. 2, pp. 293-307), that is, a Pulse Coupled Neural Network (hereinafter referred to as a ""PCNN""; Pulse Coupled Neural Network) (USP 5,664,065 and Broussard, et al., 1999, Physiologically Motivated Image Fusion for Object Detection using a Pulse Coupled Neural Net work, IEEE Trans. On Neural Networks, Vol. 10, pages 554-563, etc.). The mentioned above However, literature does not disclose specific configurations on a neural network in a method of implementation a recognition function by using analogue information, such as the interval between peaks, a peak in a timebase domain for the Encoding or the like of image information in a neural Network model to run a predetermined processing by inputting, outputting, or transmitting of lace trains. ""Information Processing in Biology-Inspired Pulse-Coded Neural Networks ""(Eckmiller et al., Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, New York, 1993) discusses a biology-inspired, impulse-processing neural network (BPN), in which each neuron has three pulses generated from a single received input pulse. The three Pulses are through three synapses with each adjustable delays and adjustable weights generated. The generated pulses are then summed and low-pass filtered, and an output pulse is passed through the neuron generates, if this filtered value a threshold reached. Pulse Techniques in Neural VLSI: A Review discusses a number of pulsed current techniques for implementing an output function of neurons in a neural network. The discussed methods include phase amplitude modulation, phase width modulation, and phase frequency modulation, delay modulation, impulse addition, pulse width multiplication, and phase amplitude modulation  tiplikation. Regarding one Image recognition algorithm was requested for a system whose Performance especially independent from position, size, etc. an object to be recognized on a screen. Many systems have been proposed in the past to meet such needs correspond to. For example, one can make changes to the scale or rotation invariant recognition by performing ""conforming image processing"" as preprocessing be achieved. More accurate said, the log-polar coordinate transformation over a Logarithm of the distance from the midpoint of a recognizable Object in an image and the rotation angle of the same executed. This causes a change the size or the rotation of the same object, which in a parallel shift in a coordinate system after the conversion is to be converted. Thereafter, when a feature size (for example, a correlation coefficient) becomes is calculated, the object to be recognized with respect to the same Feature size recorded become. The invariance of the collection performance versus positional changes can be done by sequentially shifting the midpoint of the transformation, to perform the detection at each position. Further became the possibility of performing a comparable size invariant Acquisition by obtaining a multivariable representation for each local region in one given picture and further running the conforming image conversion mentioned above (Wechseler, H., 1992, ""Multi-scale and Distributed Visual Representations and Mappings for Invariant-Low-Level Perception ""in Neural Networks for Perception, Vol. 1, Wechsler, H., Ed., Pp. 462-476, Academic Press, Boston). consequently is a method in which the conventional predetermined image conversion (conforming image conversion, etc.) is performed to pattern recognition to implement, where the recognition performance is invariant recognizable objects that have different scales, a problem to that effect shown that it is difficult to scale-invariant features too receive, as long as not the midpoint of the conversion to appropriate Way is set. The The following are the examples using a different style describe where the the similarity calculated to the model of a object to be recognized feature size and the recognition is achieved without relying on size can be. One such example is a method in which the model data of an object to be recognized in variable Scales as Template models are presented in advance, and a template match with an input image or its feature vectors from roughly finely executed (Rosenfeld and Vanderburg, 1977, Coarse to fine template matching, IEEE Trans. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Vol. 2, pp. 104-107). In another method becomes an input pattern on an eigen image function space imaged by performing the principal component analysis of model images of objects in variable Sizes received and the distance of models in a feature space is calculated (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-153198, Murase, Nayar, 1995, Image spotting of 3D objects by multiple resolution and eigenspace representation, Information Processing Academy Proceedings, Vol. 36, pages 2234-2243; Murase and Nayar, 1997, Detection of 3D objects in cluttered scenes using hierarchical eigenspace, Pattern Recognition Letters, pages 375-384). In In yet another method, the position and size of a corresponding region calculated and normalized, based on the range image data via an object to be recognized, and then a match is performed (Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-108804). In yet another Methods are the multi-resolution data relating to a object to be recognized in the order of one level lower resolution to a level of high resolution shifted, thereby detecting including a match perform (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-315141). The on the template match based method presented a problem in terms of practicability in that that if, then, a match with the template models in different scales, previously shown have been performed is, a high detection performance can not be achieved who can, as long as not an object in an input image, essentially one complies with the standards, which means many different template models required are. In the method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 8-153198, in which the parametric eigenspace obtained by performing the principal component analysis of model images of an object over a finite number of different sizes, the changes in FIG  Size is represented by manifolds of a parametric eigenspace so that objects of different sizes can be sequentially recognized. However, this method presents a problem that the dimension of a covariance matrix is large (for example, 16,384 dimensions in the case described by Murase and Nayar 1995), which inevitably requires enormously high costs for calculating eigenvectors. In order to obtain adequate accuracy to successfully deal with the size changes, reference images having different sizes of about five levels of 1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x, 1.4x, and 1.5 times (= α) of a reference quantity to calculate eigenvectors, then an input image must be converted into sizes of α-1-fold, α-2-fold, α-3-fold, etc. This required an extremely large storage space and an enormously long time to compute to complete the processing. In accordance with those in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 8-315141 disclosed method is the match starting from a low resolution towards a high resolution one another following for Multi-resolution representation of data in terms of an object created in advance. Therefore is it to a scale invariant Perform detection, necessary, a sufficiently high level of multiplexing in advance resolutions to be created to provide, resulting in a low processing efficiency leads. Because of this, the process can be used to gain rough information However, using less storage is appropriate for detection or detection, which requires high accuracy, not suitable. When a method that uses time-series input of images, there is one in which a variety of hypotheses regarding a object to be recognized, which compete with each other, from a picture generated, the hypotheses are accumulated in time, then a category classifier, such as an ART2 of Carpenter et al. (Seibert, et al., 1992, Learning and Recognizing 3D objects from multiple views in a neural system, in Neural Networks for Perception, Vol. 1, Human and Machine Perception Ed.), Academic Press, pp. 427-444). When one based on a neural network model based on a key on an information processing mechanism of a living organism there is one, based pattern recognition method, where a dynamically routing network is used to a scale and position invariant Representation, which is centered around an object (Anderson, et al., 1995, Routing Networks in Visual Cortex, in Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks (M.Arbib, Ed.), MIT Press, pp. 823-826, Olhausen et al., 1995, A Multiscale Dynamic Routing Circuit for Forming Size and Position-Invariant Object Representations, J. Computational Neuroscience, vol. 2, pages 45-62). In accordance with this procedure becomes a hierarchical representation (a multi-resolution representation) based on a variety of different resolutions in the Advance for Image data performed, and becomes an informational routing over the mediator of a control neuron carried out, this is a function for dynamically setting a connection weight has, causing the information to appear at different resolutions a representation be imaged centering around an object. The on the dynamically routing network (Anderson et al., 1995; Olshausen et al., 1995) requires a mechanism for dynamic setting of the connection between nervous cell elements between predetermined scale levels by means of a local concurrent process between control neurons, and thus presents a problem that the circuit configuration inevitably becomes complicated. The Method in which competing hypotheses are generated and a Category classifier (Seibert et al., 1992), based on time-series images, which makes it inherently difficult makes, a scale-independent detection to achieve from a single still image. at an image recognition algorithm, it is considered important that Calculation costs or the required for recognition processing Weight by achieving recognition mainly by selective Moving a considered region from the analogy with a to reduce biological system processing. For example, according to the hierarchical information processing method disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 6-34236, a plurality of descending signal paths, which are directed from an upper layer to a lower layer, are used to intersect with a plurality of ascending signal paths a lower layer are directed to an upper layer to match, provided between a plurality of hierarchies, the feature extraction element layers and feature  tegrationsschichten, the output signals based on the output signals of feature extraction elements, which are associated with the same feature have. The transmission of rising signals is controlled in response to the descending signals from a topmost layer to perform segmentation by selectively extracting a self-re-assembling associative capability and a specific pattern, thereby defining a processing region or a fixation region for recognition. Initially based that tested in Japanese Patent publication No. 6-34236, on an assumption that that there is a descending signal path that is hierarchical neural circuit configuration with an ascending signal path is paired. Therefore, a neural circuit is about as big as that the rising signal path corresponding neural circuit as a circuit is required which forms the descending signal path, which disadvantageously results in an extremely large circuit size. Furthermore this method is with no mechanism for controlling the sequential change of fixing positions, which is a problem represents that the operation is unstable when a considered region due to the influences set or changed by noise or other factors. More specifically, exist about all hierarchies between the elements of an intermediate layer of the ascending path and the elements of an intermediate layer of the descending pathway interim, and becomes a fixation position finally over all Interactions determined. This has presented a problem in that that if there are a variety of objects in the the same category, the positions of fixation points not be controlled so that they are in between the objects sequentially shift a stable way, which leads to a fixation position only between certain objects or in nearby the same back and forth. It Another problem was that if there were a lot of objects that are in the same category as the one to be captured or discerning object in input data, a fine setting performed by network parameters must be whenever processing for a variety of objects (essentially non-viewing processing) occurs simultaneously or whenever an update of the viewing position is performed. In accordance with the publication USP 4876731 the aforementioned ascending Signal path and the aforementioned descending signal path on the Basis of contextual information (rulebase, probability weighting) starting from an output layer, that is, an uppermost layer, controlled. In accordance Patent No. 2856702 relates to a modifying recognition on a consideration. A pattern recognition device is provided with a viewing degree determiner for selecting a viewing degree for every Subregion to a precise Detect if a pattern is not identified can, and a viewing degree control means for performing a Detection in which the selected Viewing level has been mirrored. A system for controlling the establishment of an attention region by selective routing proposed by Koch and Ullman in 1985 (Human Neurobiology, Vol. 4, pp. 219-227) is provided with a protrusion level map extracting mechanism, which includes feature extraction a selective imaging mechanism, a viewing-position selecting mechanism using a ""winner-take-all"" neuronal network (hereinafter referred to as ""winner-take-all"" neuronal network) (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei. 5-242069, the publicationUS5049758, the pamphletUS5059814, the pamphletUS5146106, etc.), and combines a mechanism for inhibiting neural elements at a selected position. In the selective route based method described above System is not in the control of considered positions easy to control the considered items efficiently because the system only has a mechanism to inhibit a selected region equipped is. Therefore, there have been some cases in which the control of the positions of points considered on focused on a particular object or section becomes. In accordance with the method based on the aforesaid dynamic routing network, routing of information is performed via the median of a control neuron having a function of dynamically setting the connection weight to thereby determine contemplated regions  Control and transform a feature representation of an object to be recognized, which focuses on an observer, into a representation centered on the object. The configures the system using the dynamic routing network however the inter-layer connection over the mediator of many control neurons, for which a synaptic connection weight can be changed dynamically, new, so that the circuit configuration inevitably becomes complicated. About that In addition, the control neurons involve processing from below up based on the level of feature excellence a lower layer, so it was difficult to efficient To achieve control of considered positions, if a multitude of objects of the same category. at the selective voting procedure (Culhane & Tsotsos, 1992, An Attentional Prototype for Early Vision. Proceedings of Second European Conference on Computer Vision, (G. Sadini Ed.), Springer-Verlag, Pages 551-560), a search is performed by a mechanism that only wins out one WTA circuit of a top layer to a WTA circuit of a bottom Layer activated to over the position of a total winner of the topmost layer in one lowest layer, which receives directly the input data Layer is to decide. The selection of a position and the selection a feature performed in the viewing control, are irrelevant to the position by inhibiting a connection an object and by inhibiting an element that is irrelevant to a feature for the Object captured, implemented. The System based on a hierarchical and dynamic selective Voting based leads a thinning-like Selection by which a connection that is not on selected Object refers, only thinned This poses a problem that if one Variety of objects are present, then it is not easy to efficiently control the positions of fixation points. Further the prior art described above has in common the following disadvantages. First is not one of the systems with mechanisms described above which are able to with different sizes of to deal with objects to be recognized. Therefore, if objects in different Sizes at the same time exist in a variety of positions, it was then necessary To tune network parameters to each of a variety of scenes, in which the sizes of the to be recognized objects are different. Secondly It was then when a variety of objects belonging to the same category belong, are present at a plurality of positions in input data, impossible, evenly and to move efficiently viewed positions across the objects or to update. By the way Noted, it was well known that using analogue Circuit elements it possible makes to achieve a simplified circuit configuration, which compared to a digital system fewer elements, higher speed, and lower power consumption means. On the other hand however threw the circuit configurations using analog circuit elements Problems with immunity to noise and reliability of input / output characteristics, the variations in the characteristic attributable to individual elements.

The what path mainly handles information relating to the detection or detection of an object or geometric feature, whereas the wo path mainly handles information related to the position or arrangement of an object or feature. Of the What path has a ""tortuous Network structure ""(cf. LeCun, Y. and Bengio, Y., 1995, ""Convolutional Networks for Images Speech, and Time Series ""in Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks (M. Arbib, Ed.), MIT Press, pp. 255-259). The what-path is different However, one of the prior art is that an interlayer compound can establish a reciprocal connection in the same path, which will be discussed below. A final edition of the was path corresponds to a recognition result, that is, the Category of a recognized object. The final output of the where path represents a position associated with a recognition result. A data input layer101is formed by a photoelectric converter, such as a CMOS sensor or a CCD element, in a device for detecting and recognizing images, or by a voice input sensor in a device for detecting and recognizing speech. Alternatively, the data input layer101Receive higher-order data obtained from an analysis result of a predetermined data analyzer (for example, principal component analysis and vector quantization). The data input layer101provides the same data to the aforementioned two paths. Below are the descriptions of a case in which an image is fed. The was path includes feature detection layers102((1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (1, N)) and feature integration layers103((2, 0), (2, 1), ..., (2, N)). The first feature detection layer (1, 0) performs a Gabor wavelet transform or the like to generate a plurality of low order local features or types of the same one of the data input layer101received image pattern at individual positions on the entire screen or at predetermined sampling points across the entire screen across. In this case, you can  the low-order local features include geometric features and color component features. For this purpose, each layer has reception fields105and a variety of acquisition modules104for detecting different characteristics. The respective acquisition modules104have receive field structures for different types of feature sizes, and are composed of neurons that generate pulse trains accordingly. For example, to extract a line segment in a predetermined direction as a geometric feature, the detection module104a reception field structure adapted for the inclination of the line segment, which is a geometric structure thereof. The feature integration layer103(2, 0) has a plurality of feature integration modules106on. Each of the feature integration modules106has a predetermined reception field structure, and is composed of pulse train generating neuron elements. By performing a sub-sample calculation, such as local averaging or maximum output detection in the receive field, each of the feature integration modules integrates106a plurality of neuron element outputs in the same receive field received by the feature detect layer102(1, 0) are received. The reception fields share the same structure among the neurons in the same layer. Subsequent layers, that is, feature trapping layers102((1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, N)) and the feature integration layers103((2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, N)) have predetermined reception field structures obtained by learning. As in the case of the aforementioned layers, the earlier layers ((1, 1), ...) detect a plurality of different features in the feature detection modules104whereas the later layers ((2, 1),...) detect detection results regarding a plurality of features detected by the feature detection layer102received in a previous stage, integrate and have a similar function and structure as those of the feature integration layer103(2, 0). The Wo path with feature location acquisition layers107((3, 0), ..., (3, k)) receives the outputs from predetermined (not necessarily all) feature integration layers103on the what path, and are involved in the outputs of the positions of low order, middle order, and high order features. In the following descriptions, no further detailed explanation will be given for each layer of the Wo path. As in2Ais shown includes a structure for connecting neuron elements201between layers a signal transmission section203(Wiring or a delay line) corresponding to an axial fiber or a dendritic nerve cell, and a synapse circuit S202.2Ashows a configuration of a connection with respect to an output from a neuron group (ni)of a Merkmalintegrations- or detection cell, which forms a receiving box for a certain Merkmalerfassungs- or integration cell N (the output in this case is the input, such as from cell N, starting observed). The signal transmission section indicated by a bold line203forms a common bus line, and pulse signals from a plurality of neurons are arranged and transmitted in a time series on the signal transmission line. The same configuration is used for receiving an input signal from a destination cell N. In this case, input signals and output signals can be divided and processed on a time basis in the exact same configuration, or they can be formed by forming the in the same2similar configuration shown using two systems, one for the input (the dendrite end) and the other for the output (the axial fiber end) processed. The synapse circuit S202 exists in two ways. One way is adapted for an inter-layer connection, which is the connection between a neuron on the feature detection layer102and a neuron on the feature integration layer103and each layer may have a connection to its subsequent layer or layer. The other way is adapted for a connection between neurons in the same layer. The latter type, as appropriate, uses a connection between a pacemaker neuron, which will be discussed below, and a feature detection or integration neuron. In the synapse circuit S202 amplified an ""excitation connection"" a pulse signal, while an inhibition compound attenuates a pulse signal. If information by means of Transmitted pulse signals, can the pulse signals by any one of amplitude modulation, pulse width modulation, phase modulation, or frequency modulation amplified or toned down or steamed become. In this embodiment, the synapse circuit S202 mainly functions as a pulse phase modulating means, and the amplification of a signal as a fundamental flow of an Im  pulse arrival time is handled as an intrinsic feature in the trait, while the weakening is converted as a fundamental lag. More specifically, as will be discussed below, a synaptic junction provides an arrival time or phase intrinsic to a trait at a destination neuron. Qualitatively, the excitation connection provides a phase advance of an arrival pulse relative to a particular reference phase. The inhibition compound also provides a delay. Referring to2AEach neuron element njoutputs a pulse signal or peak train, and is an ""integration and fire type"", which will be discussed below. As in2C3, the synapse circuit and the neuron elements may be combined into one circuit block. The feature position detection layers107in the where path, shown in1, receive the outputs of the feature detection layers103or the like of the what-path. At grid points that were roughly scanned while in a positional relationship on the data input layer101was maintained, only those neurons assigned to the components usable for recognition (that is, the components registered in advance from a pattern of recognition category) were included in a feature extraction result on the what path, by filtering, or the like speak to. To the For example, in the top layer in the where path, those are the category of a neuron to be recognized on a grid arranged to indicate the position where the object exists is. The neurons in an intermediate layer in the where path can do this be adapted, a sensitivity adjustment or the like so that they only appeal when a feature is detected This is done when receiving a top-down Entry from an upper layer in the Wo path around the Position at which the object to be recognized exists, centering can be arranged or upon receipt of an input which is supplied via a route, that of an upper layer of the Wo path → an upper layer of the Wo path → an intermediate layer the Wo path is formed. If the where path is used, a collection of hierarchical Perform characteristics, in which the positional relationship between detected features (the positional information) is maintained, the receive field structure should be be made to be local (eg elliptical) is and gradually becomes larger towards an upper layer, or at a constant one Size remains, which is larger as a pixel on a sensor surface, starting from an intermediate layer towards an upper layer. This makes it possible to feature elements (graphic elements) in respective layers, while the positional relationship between feature elements, such as geometric structural elements and figural or graphic Pattern, on a sensor surface maintained to a certain extent becomes. When another mode of the Wo path may employ a neural network by moving the reception field towards an upper layer grows hierarchically, and in the top layer only the neuron, which has a maximum Output value under the category associated with a detected object Neurons fires. In such a system, the information in terms of the dispositional relationship or a spatial arrangement through the phase in a data input layer, also to one to a certain extent the top layer and stored in interlayers. When another output mode of the Wo path may be an observed region a predetermined size on one Data input layer based on the feature protrusion map, that from the output results of a feature detection layer (1, 0), and can determine the position and size of the specified Region and the presence of the category of the object to be recognized be spent in it. As yet another mode, a neural network can be applied by the receive field in Becomes hierarchically larger towards an upper layer, and in the top layer only the neuron, which has a maximum Output value under the category associated with a detected object Neurons fires. In such a system, the information in terms of the dispositional relationship or a spatial arrangement in one Data input layer also in the top layer and intermediate layers saved to a certain extent. neuron element below The neurons forming each layer will be described. Every neuron element is an advanced model based on an ""integrating-and-firing-neuron"", and is comparable to the integrating-and-firing neuron in that it Fires and outputs a pulse signal if a result obtained becomes when input signals (impulse trains equivalent to action potentials) linear in a spatio-temporal Way, exceeds a threshold. 2 BFig. 14 shows an example of a basic configuration illustrating the operation principle of a pulse generating circuit (CMOS circuit) acting as a neuron element. This was obtained by extending a known circuit (see IEEE Trans. On Neural Networks, Vol. 10, p. The example is configured to receive stimulating and inhibitory input signals. The operation principle of the pulse generating circuit will be described below. The time constant of a circuit on a capacitor C1and a resistor R1, which is connected to an excitation input end, is smaller than the time constant of a circuit of a capacitor C2and a resistor R2, and transistors T1, T2and T3are switched OFF in a constant state. The resistors are in fact constructed by means of transistors coupled in a diode mode. When the potential of the capacitor C1rises and the potential of the capacitor C2exceeds the threshold of the transistor T1, the transistor T1 isactivated, causing the transistors T2and T3 to becomeactive. The transistors T2and T3form a current mirror circuit, and the output of the in2 BThe circuit shown is output at the end of the capacitor C1by means of an output circuit (not shown). When a charge storage amount of the capacitor C2 reachesa maximum level, the transistor T1 is turnedOFF, which causes the transistors T2and T3 to be turnedOFF, and that a positive feedback becomes zero. During a ""refractory period"", the capacitor C2discharges and does not respond to the neurons until the potential of the capacitor T1 isgreater than the potential of the capacitor C2and the difference therebetween exceeds the threshold of the transistor T1. The repetition of alternately charging and discharging the capacitors C1and C2causes periodic pulses to be output whose frequencies are generally determined based on the level of a stimulating input signal. However, the presence of the refractory period makes it possible to limit the maximum frequency or to output a constant frequency. The potentials, that is, the charge storage amounts of the capacitors are timed by means of a reference voltage control circuit (a time window weighting function generating circuit)204controlled. The control characteristic is reflected in the weighted addition of input pulses in a time window (cf.7). The reference voltage control circuit204generates a reference voltage signal, which is the in7Bat an input signal time from a pacing neuron (which will be discussed below) or based on an input via a mutual connection with a neuron of a subsequent layer. In this embodiment are there cases in which the inhibitory inputs are dispensable; however, it does setting the inputs from a pacemaker neuron (which will be discussed below) to a neuron of a feature detection layer inhibitory inputs possible, to prevent output signals from divergence or saturation. in the general hangs the relationship between the total of input signals and an output level (pulse phase, pulse frequency, pulse width, etc.) on the sensitivity of each neuron. The sensitivity can by feeding an input from top to bottom starting from an upper layer changed become. The following descriptions will simplify the statement assume that circuit parameters have been set that the frequencies of pulse outputs are based on total sums of input signals rising steeply (essentially binary in one Frequency range accordingly). It is also believed that Output levels, including from Timings that are subjected to a phase modulation, in accordance change with the pulse phase modulation. For a pulse phase modulator, the in5shown circuit, which will be described below. This causes the weighting function in a time window  is controlled by the foregoing reference voltage to change the phase of a pulse output from the neuron, and the updated phase can be related to the output level of the neuron. The time τw1is equivalent to a maximum value of in7B5, which characterizes that the temporal integration or receive sensitivity for a pulse subjected to pulse phase modulation by synaptic connection is generally determined to be earlier than an expected pulse arrival time τs1, which is intrinsic to synaptic Is lent feature. As a result, for pulses arriving by a predetermined range earlier than the expected arrival time, the neuron receiving these pulses temporally integrates them as a pulse signal having a high output level. In the in7BIn the example shown, pulses that arrive too early are attenuated. The forms of weighting functions are not limited to geometric shapes, such as Gaussian; instead, the weighting function may take on an asymmetrical shape. It is noted that the center of each weighting function shown in Figure seven image is not an expected pulse arrival time. Of the Beginning of a time window provides the reference for the phase of a neuron output (before synapse), as will be discussed below, and a delay in phase from the reference is by a charge storage amount determines if a reference pulse based on a pacemaker output etc. is received. A detailed explanation of a circuit configuration to impart such output characteristic is omitted because they are not related to the main theme of the present invention Has. A postsynaptic impulse phase is created by adding the pre synaptic phase to a specific phase modulation amount provided by the synapse. When An alternative may use a known circuit configuration which is designed to be an oscillation output with a predetermined delay in time response, when a grand total of input signals, obtained using a window function or the like were exceeded a threshold. The neuron element is a neuron that belongs to the feature detection layer102or the feature integration layer103and has a circuit configuration in which the neuron outputs a pulse having a phase delay based on the input level (given by a simple sum or a weighted total of the aforementioned input signals) received from the reception field of the layer in the preceding stage, after receiving a pulse output from a pacemaker neuron, when controlling a firing pattern based on the pacing neuron output times, which will be discussed below. In this case, before a pulse signal is received from the pacemaker neuron, there is a transient transient state in which neurons output pulses in random phases to each other in accordance with input levels. As will be described below, if a pacemaker neuron is not used, a circuit configuration may be used in which a synchronous fire signal generated by the interconnection of neurons between the feature detection layer102and the feature integration layer103and network dynamics was obtained when the reference is used, and the firing times for output pulses of feature detection layer neurons are controlled in accordance with the aforementioned input levels. The neuron of the feature detection layer102has a receive field structure based on its feature category as described above. When the total weighted sum value (which will be discussed below) obtained by the time window function, an input pulse signal in a current value or potential from a neuron of a layer (the input layer101or the feature integration layer103) exceeds the threshold in the preceding stage, a pulse having a level assuming a non-decreasing and non-linear function asymptotically saturated to a predetermined level, such as a sigmoid function, that is, a squeezing function value, is outputted; given by the grand total. In this case, the output levels depend on the changes in the phase; however, they may alternatively depend on the changes in frequency, amplitude, or pulse width reference. In the feature detection layer (1, 0), when it is assumed that there is a neuron N1 for detecting a pattern (low order feature) of a pattern having a predetermined spatial frequency in a local region of a certain size and a predetermined directional component .  if there is a corresponding structure in the reception field of the neuron N1 on the data input layer101For example, the neuron N1 exits an impulse in phase based on the protrusion or contrast thereof. Such a function can be implemented by a Gabor filter. The following will describe a feature detection filter function implemented by each neuron of the feature detection layer (1, 0). Processing at feature integration layers (Extraction of low order features) In the feature detection layer (1, 0) becomes a Gabor wavelet transform, the through a filter set of a multiscale and multidimensional Component represents is running. Every neuron or group that consists of a variety of neurons in the layer has a predetermined Gabor filter function. The Gabor wavelet is obtained by modeling a sinusoidal wave having a predetermined directional component and spatial frequency by the Gaussian function, and is specified by an index m of a scale plane and an index n of the directional component given by the expression (1) shown below , The filter set as the wavelet has similar functional shapes to each other, but has different principal directions and sizes from each other. It has been known that the wavelets are located in the spatial frequency domain and the Raslraumbereich, the simultaneous ambiguity in space and spatial frequency is minimized, and the wavelet is the most localized function in both the real space and the frequency space (J, G. Daugman (1985), Uncertainty relation for resolution in space, spatial frequency, and orientation optimized by two-dimensional visual cortical filters, Journal of Optical Society of America A, volume 2, pages 1160-1169).where (x, y) denotes a position in an image, ""a"" denotes a scaling factor, θndenotes the directional component of a filter, W denotes a fundamental spatial frequency, and σxand σydenote parameters which are the width in one direction Give ""x"" or a direction ""y"" to a filter function. In this embodiment, θn takesthe values of six directions, ie, 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees. Reference character ""a"" is set to 2, and ""m"" assumes an integer value of 1 to 4. The parameters σxand σyand ""a"" which determine the characteristic of a filter are preferably set so as to overlap one another correctly in a Fourier region, so as not to cause unbalanced sensitivity in any spatial frequency or direction to cause. For this purpose, the parameters are designed so that, for example, the mesial size planes of maximum amplitude values after the Fourier conversion touch each other mutually in the Fourier region, as shown below:wherein UHand ULdenote the maximum value and the minimum value, respectively, in a spatial frequency band covered by the wavelet transform, and M denotes a scale plane index within the covered range. A two-dimensional convolutional computation of the respective filters gmn(x, y) and an input variable density image is performed to perform the Gabor wavelet transform, as shown below:Wmn(x, y) = ∫I (x1, y1)G*mn(x - y1, y - y1) dx1dy1= Amn(x, y) exp {iPmn(x, y)} (4)where I denotes an input image, and Wmndenotes a Gabor wavelet transform coefficient. The set of Wmn(m = 1, ..., 4; n = 1, ..., 6) is used as a feature vector applied at each point. The asterisk ""*"" indicates that a complex conjugate is used. Thus, each neuron of the featuredetection layer(1, 0) has a reception field structure based on gmn, and outputs pulses at a level which assumes a nonlinear squeeze function of a wavelet transform coefficient value obtained by inputting the sum of products of a distribution weighting factor and image data has been. In this embodiment, a phase-Darstellung based representation is used, but alternatively a frequency, an amplitude, or a pulse width may be used. Thus, the Gabor wavelet transform was performed according to expression (4) to obtain the output of the entire layer (1, 0). Processing by feature integration layers (Extraction of middle and high order features) Different as the neurons of the preceding sense layer become the Neurons of the subsequent feature detection layers ((1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n)) of the ""Hebb learning rule"" or the like subjected to the receive field structures for detecting features in the pattern to be recognized. In a later shift approaches the size of a local region to capture a feature gradually the size of the entire, to be recognized object. latter Layers capture geometric features of medium or high order. For example, in detecting and recognizing a face the features of medium or high order on the feature on the Level of graphical elements, such as eyes, nose, and mouth forming the face. The neurons of the feature detection layer can a mechanism for receiving an inhibiting (short circuit inhibition type) input have that by issuing a layer in the preceding Level is determined to ensure stable spending. Processing at feature integration layers The neurons of the feature integration layers103((2, 0), (2, 1), ...) will now be described. As in1is the connection from the feature detection layer102(For example, (1, 0)) to the feature integration layer103(For example, (2, 0)) is configured to receive inputs via the stimulating connection of neurons in the reception field of the feature integration neuron of the same feature class or the same feature type in the preceding feature detection layer. Each neuron of the feature integration layer performs sub-sampling by local averaging,  such as by calculating an average of inputs from neurons belonging to the reception field of the feature detection neuron for each feature category. in the individual become a plurality in the process of feature integration inputted from pulses of the same feature type, and the pulses are in a local region or a local reception field integrated, and then subjected to averaging or the like. This allows a reliable Detection even if the position of the characteristic fluctuates or the feature deforms. Therefore, the structure of the receive field of neurons in the feature integration layer independent of the Feature category can be configured to be uniform. For example, each receive field may include neurons in the feature integration layer may be generated from rectangular regions of a predetermined size, and may Sensitivity or weight uniformly distributed in these. Operating principle of the pattern detection Descriptions will now be given of the pulse coding and the detection method of two-dimensional graphic patterns.3schematically shows how pulse signals from the feature integration layer103to the feature acquisition layer102(For example, from the layer (2, 0) to the layer (1, 1) shown in FIG1). Neurons ni(n1to n4) in the feature integration layer103are responsible for different feature sizes or feature elements. A neuronn'j ofthe feature detection layer102has reference to the detection of a higher order feature (graphical element) obtained by combining the features in the same reception field. An intra-neuron connection involves a feature-specific delay attributable to a pulse propagation time and a time delay or the like in the synaptic connection (Sij) from the neuron njto the neuron n 'j. As a result, the pulses in a train of pulses arrive at the neuron n 'jvia a common bus301in a predetermined order at predetermined intervals due to the amount of delay in the synaptic connection, determined by learning as long as pulses from the neuron of the feature integration layer103be issued. In the in3AAs shown, the pulses arrive in the order of P4, P3, P2, and P1. 3Bmainly represents the times at which pulses of feature integration cells n1, n2and n3, each representing a different type of feature, on a (2, k) numbered layer, become a feature detection cell (n 'j), which detects a higher-order feature, is propagated on a layer numbered (1, k + 1) when the synchronization control of the time window is performed by using the timing signals from a pacemaker neuron. 6Figure 10 shows a network configuration when receiving inputs from a pacing neuron to feature detection layer neutrons. Referring to6every pacemaker neuron becomes603(np) of feature acquisition neurons602(nj, nkand so on) forming a reception field with the same forum as that of the feature detection neuron and detecting different kinds of features, and receiving a stimulating connection of neurons601on the feature integration layer or an input layer. Further, the pacemaker neuron gives603(np) pulses to the feature detection neurons602and the feature integration neurons at predetermined times or at predetermined frequencies or frequencies that depend on total sum values of the inputs or mean values of activity levels of neurons in the receive fields that represent the activity characteristic to the receive field. The feature detection neurons602are configured to time windows using the inputs from the pacemaker neuron603be mutually phase locked as trigger signals. As mentioned above, however, the feature detection neurons are602before phase-locking an input from the pacemaker neuron so that the neurons output pulses in random phases. In addition, the feature detection neurons perform602no time window integration, which will be described below, before receiving inputs from the pacemaker neuron603receive. The integration is by one of the pacemaker neuron603received pulse triggered. In this case, the time window is defined for each feature detection cell (n 'j) which is common to the neurons in a feature integration layer which is the same receive field for the cell and the pacemaker neuron603is shared. The time window defines the time range of the time window integration. The pacemaker neuron603in a layer numbered by (1, k) (""k"" is an integer of 0 or more) gives pulses to the feature integration cells of a layer numbered by (2, k-1) and to a feature detection cell numbered by (1, k) Layer to which the pacemaker neuron belongs, thereby providing timing signals for generating time windows when the feature detection cells add inputs temporally. The start time of the time window provides the reference time for measuring the arrival time of a pulse output from each feature integration cell. Specifically, the pacemaker neuron delivers603the reference pulses for the output time of the pulses from the feature integration cells and for the time slot integration in the feature detection cells. If the feature integration cells (n1, n2,and n3) of a (2, k) numbered layer have received pulse inputs from the pacemaker neuron of the feature detection layer numbered (1, k + 1), and the activity potentials thereof are the same through the inputs of one Feature detection layer or a sensor input layer (having (1, k) numbered layer) in the preceding stage has been increased to sufficiently high levels (for example, if the average input pulse number has exceeded a threshold in a certain time range or time window), then the feature integration cells output drops the pulses from the pacemaker neuron ready. In this embodiment the feature integration cells are not configured to Timing by a pacemaker neuron on the preceding, with (1, k) numbered feature detection layer. This This is because the feature integration cells impulse on the Basis of a phase determined by an input level, such as for example, a total time value of an input pulse, in a predetermined time range instead of on the basis output an input pulse arrival time pattern; therefore the is Time window generation time not very important. By the way the preceding phase may be defined by a frequency, a pulse width, or an amplitude to be replaced, although the present embodiment the phase used. Obviously, the main point is here not in excluding the configuration in which the feature integration cells the timing control of the pacemaker neurons of a feature detection layer received in the previous layer. The point is that, the possibility to suggest such a configuration. Each pulse passes through a synapse in which it is provided with a predetermined amount of phase delay, and further passes through a signal transmission line, such as a common bus, before finally reaching a feature detection cell. The time base arranged pulses at this time are represented by the pulses P1, P2and P3, which are indicated by dotted lines on the time bases of the feature detection cell. If the time slot integration of the pulses P1, P2and P3in the feature detection cell results in a value exceeding the threshold, then a pulse P4 isoutput as the reference using the time when the time window ends. Normally, the time window integration is performed once; alternatively, however, the stored charges obtained from timeslot integration implemented several times or the timeslot integrations implemented several times may be averaged. The time window in a learning mode, shown in3B, is used when implementing a learning rule, which will be described below. synapse circuit 4shows the configuration of a synapse circuit Si.4Amakes small circuits401, which are arranged in a matrix pattern, around each neuron n 'j, with which the neuron niin a synapse circuit202(Si) is connected to confer synaptic connection strength or phase delay. This arrangement allows the wiring from the synapse circuit to a target neuron to be achieved on the same line, that is, a local common bus301, In other words, the wiring between neurons can be virtually achieved, so that the wiring problem in the prior art is improved or solved. In addition, when a target neuron receives a plurality of pulse inputs from the same reception field, it can identify the neurons having supplied the respective pulse inputs on the time base by the arrival time of each pulse in accordance with the time slot reference. The above-mentioned arrival time corresponds to a feature detected by a feature detection cell, and refers to a phase delay that is for a low-order feature constituting the feature  is old. As in4Bis shown, every small synapse cell exists401from a learning circuit402and a phase delay circuit403, The learning circuit402changes the characteristic of the phase delay circuit403for adjusting the above delay amount, and stores the feature values or the control values thereof on a potential-free element, a floating-gate element, or a potential-free element-coupled capacitor. 5shows the detailed configuration of the small synaptic connection circuit. The phase delay circuit403is a pulse phase modulation circuit, which by eg monostable multivibrators506and507, Resistors501and504, Capacitors503and505, and a transistor502can be formed as in5Ais shown.5Bshows the times of a square wave P1 ([1] of5B), the monostable multivibrator506is fed, a square wave P2 ([2] of5B), by the monostable multivibrator506is output, and a square wave P3 ([3] of5B), by the monostable multivibrator507is issued. The detailed descriptions of the operation mechanism of the phase delay circuit403are omitted. The pulse width of P1 depends on the time required for the voltage of the capacitor503by means of a charging current reaches a preset threshold, while the pulse width of P2 of the by the resistor504and the capacitor505given pulse width depends. If the pulse width of P2 is the same as the square wave represented by the dotted line in5Bis indicated, extends, and the drop point thereof shifts backward, then the rise point of P3 shifts accordingly; however, the pulse width of P3 remains unchanged. As a result, only the phases of the input pulses are modulated when the pulses are output. The pulse phase or the amount of delay can be changed by changing a control voltage Ec by means of a refresh circuit509, which supplies a reference voltage, and the learning circuit402controlling the amount of charge stored in the capacitor that provides a connection weight. In order to maintain the connection weight for a prolonged period of time, the connection weight may be expressed as the charge of a floating element (not shown) external to that in FIG5Ais stored after a learning operation, or stored by writing or the like in a digital memory. Moreover, a configuration configured to reduce a circuit size (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 5-37317 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-327054) or other well-known circuit configurations may be used. If the network involves a common connection weight in which a synaptic connection is represented by common weighting factors, then the delay amount Pij ofthe expression given below (FIG.5) are made equal at each synapse between reception fields. In particular, the connection may be from the feature detection layer102to the feature integration layer103be configured independently of an object or object to be detected as mentioned above because the feature integration layer103is involved in sub-sampling or otherwise, which is generally independent of the class of objects formed by the local averaging of the output of the feature detection layer102which is the feature integration layer103preceding layer. In this case, each in4Ashown small circuit Sk, i, by means of the local common bus401is connected, as in4Bis shown, so that a particularly economical circuit configuration is achieved. If the connection from the feature integration layer103or the sensor input layer101to the feature acquisition layer102As described above, the feature detection neurons detect an event in which a plurality of pulses representing different feature elements arrive simultaneously or arrive at substantially the same time. If connections are symmetric, then the connections for providing the same weight or phase delay amount may be representative of the same small circuit for synaptic connection. With this arrangement, a considerable number of synaptic connections can be given by a smaller number of circuits. Especially for detecting geometric features, there are many cases in which connection weights are symmetrically distributed in a reception field; therefore, the number of synaptic connection circuits can be reduced to the scarf  size significantly. An example of the learning circuit at a synapse for implementing the simultaneous arrival of pulses or a predetermined phase modulation amount may include the circuit elements as in FIG5Cshown included. In detail, the learning circuit402from a pulse propagation time measuring circuit510a time window generating circuit511, and a pulse phase modulation amount setting circuit512for setting the pulse phase modulation amount at a synapse such that the propagation time is set to a predetermined value. The propagation time in this case refers to the difference between the time at which a pulse was output at a preceding synapse of a neuron of a particular slice and the time at which the pulse arrives at a destination neuron of the succeeding slice. The propagation time measuring circuit510is primarily configured to receive clock pulses from a pacemaker neuron, as will be discussed below, and the propagation time based on the outputs of a counter circuit for the clock pulses in a predetermined time width or window, shown in FIG3B, certainly. The time window is set by taking the firing time of a destination neuron as a reference so as to apply the extended Hebb learning rule described below. learning rule For the learning circuit402For example, the width of the time window can be reduced with increasing frequency or frequency with which objects of the same category are presented. This allows the learning circuit402to perform an operation closer to a coincidence detection mode (a plurality of pulses arrive at the same time) because a pattern belongs to a more familiar category, which means that there are a larger number of presentations or learning opportunities. This arrangement makes it possible to reduce the time required to detect features or to perform an immediate detection, whereas it is not suitable for performing detailed comparative analyzes of the spatial arrangements of feature elements, identifying similar patterns or the like. In the process of learning a delay amount by, for example, extending to a complex-numbered range, a complex connection weight Cijbetween a neuron ni ofa feature detection layer and a neuron nj ofa feature integration layer is given by:Cij= Sijexp (iPij) (5)wherein the first i in a function exp denotes an imaginary unit, Sijdenotes the connection strength, and Pijdenotes a phase corresponding to a time delay of a pulse signal output from a neuron j to a neuron i at a predetermined frequency becomes. Sijreflects the reception field structure of the neuron i and generally has a structure that differs in accordance with an object or feature to be recognized or detected. This is separately formed by learning (supervised learning or self-organization), or designed as a preset structure. Further, the learning rule for self-organization relating to the extent of delay is given by:Ċij= βSijexp {-i2πτij} - Cij(6)wherein C denotes a time differentiation of Cij,τij,the foregoing time delay (a preset amount) respectively, and β (-1) denotes a constant. Solving the above expression causes, Cijto converge to βexp -i2πτ{ij},so that Pijto converge to -τij.An example in which the learning rule is applied will be described with reference to the time window in the learning mode shown in FIG3B, explained. A connection weight is updated in accordance with the expression (6) only when the neurons (n1, n2, and n3), presynaptic neurons, and a postsynaptic neuron, that is, fire a feature detection cell, both within the time range of the learning time window. In3Bfires the feature detection cell after the elapse of the time window; alternatively, however, it may fire before the elapse of the time window shown in the drawing. One another method may be for the learning rule will be used. Next alternatively, the principle of competing learning be to cause pulses at a predetermined interval or longer arrive at a distance from each other, that is, the difference in the Time delay on set a predetermined value or more. Processing at the characteristic entry layer The The following will be processing in a learning mode and a recognition mode describe the primary are implemented in the feature detection layers. Each feature detection layer102receives pulse signals relating to a plurality of different features from the same reception field as described above, and calculates a spatio-temporally weighted sum or sum of weights, and executes threshold processing. The features associated with impulses arrive at predetermined time intervals in a delay amount or phase determined by learning. The The learning control procedure of the pulse arrival time pattern is not a major point the present application, leaving only a least possible description is given. For example, a competing tutorial introduced, in which if a feature element that is a particular graphical Forming patterns is one of the most outstanding features the capture of the graphic pattern, this feature element arrives first, and the feature elements whose degrees of protrusion almost are the same, with predetermined time intervals between each other Arrive. Alternatively, the learning control may be configured that predetermined feature elements at different time intervals Arrive. Refer to the predefined feature elements in this case on the feature elements that form an object to be recognized, and are considered particularly important (for example, a size mean curvature and a high degree of linearity). The degree of salience is equivalent to, for example, the strength of the response (the pulse delay amount in this embodiment) of a cell for detecting feature elements when the graphic pattern is detected. In this case, the neurons corresponding to the lower-order feature elements in the same reception field on the feature integration layer which is the layer in the preceding stage will fire synchronously or output pulses in predetermined phases. It is obvious that if the neuron in the feature integration layer103has a connection to a feature detection neuron for detecting the high-order feature located at a different position (in this case, the neuron has a different reception field, but has a connection that gives the same high-order feature), the neuron also fires synchronously. However, the output level depends on a grand total or the like or the like of the contributions from a plurality of pacemaker neurons provided for each receive field. The output level in this example uses phases as a reference; alternatively, however, frequencies, amplitudes, or pulse widths may be used as a reference. In every neuron in the feature detection layer102For example, the spatiotemporal weighted sum of input pulses is calculated for a pulse train that reaches the neuron only in a time window of a predetermined width. The means for performing the weighted addition in the time window are not those in2shown neuron element circuit limited; another method can be used. The Time window corresponds to a certain extent of a period except the refractory period of a real neuron. In detail there it's a similarity to the real neuron, that during the refactoric period, this means, the time range except the time window, no output is provided by a neuron, whatever input it can receive, whereas firing based on an input level in the time window outside the refractory period takes place. In the3BThe refractory period shown is a period from the point immediately following the firing of a feature detection cell to the beginning time of the next time window. Obviously, the duration of the refractory period and the width of the time window can be set to any values. The refractory period need not be shorter than the time window as in the3Bshown case. The start time of the time window may be made equal between the neurons of the feature detection layers and the feature integration layers, without the need for pacemaker neurons, by introducing the mechanism in which synchronous firing is achieved primarily by a weak mutual crossover  Communication between neurons and predetermined connection conditions takes place (EM Izhikevich, 1999, ""Weakly Pulse-Coupled Oscillation, FM Interactions, Synchronization, and Oscillatory Associative Memory"", IEEE Trans. On Neural Networks, Vol. 10, pp. 508-526). It is known that synchronous firing is generally triggered by a mutual connection between neurons and a deadweight phenomenon. Therefore can also in the embodiment such an effect can be obtained without pacemaker neurons be used by using a configuration that the Conditions for the weak mutual connection between neurons and for a predetermined one synaptic connections met. In the embodiment, as explained above, the same start time may be achieved by, for example, applying timing information or a clock pulse from a pacemaker neuron (which outputs pulses having a fixed frequency) to each neuron of one of the feature detection layers, as schematically illustrated in FIG6with the pacemaker neuron receiving inputs from the same group of neurons in the receive field. With such an arrangement would be even if there is a synchronization control of time slots is necessary, not necessary, the synchronization control over the entire network. Furthermore even if clock pulses fluctuate or vary, such as mentioned above, the influences uniformly applied to the output from the same local receive field. More accurate expressed becomes the positional fluctuation of a window function in the time domain between the neurons, which form the same reception field, remain unchanged. Consequently, the reliability becomes feature detection will not be degraded. The local circuit control allows it, a more reliable, achieve synchronous operation, which in a higher tolerance across from results in variations in the parameters of circuit elements. For better understanding, descriptions will be given of a feature detection neuron for detecting a triangle as a feature. It is assumed that the feature integration layer103in the preceding stage, graphical features or feature elements such as L-shaped patterns (f11, f12, ...,) with various orientations, patterns consisting of combinations of continuity line segments or linked to those L-shaped patterns are formed (f21, f22, ...,), and patterns formed of combinations of sections of two sides of triangles (f31, f32, ...,) as in7Cshown, appeals. Reference numerals f41, f42and f43in FIG7Cdenote the features forming triangles with different orientations and denote the features corresponding to f11, f12and f13with different orientations. When a certain delay amount is determined by learning for the interlayer connection establishing neurons, it is set in the neuron for detecting a triangle as a feature such that the neuron is assigned impulses, the main features and different features forming a triangle in each sub time window or time slot (w1, w2, ...,) obtained by dividing the time slot. For example, there are the combinations of the sets of features that form a triangle as a whole, wherein w1,w2,..., wn, obtained by first n-fold dividing the time window, how in7Ais shown. The delay amounts are determined by learning so that the L-shaped patterns (f11, f12and f13) arrive at w1, w2and w3, respectively, and the feature elements (f21, f22and f23) associated pulses arrive at each w1, w2and w3. The pulses associated with the feature elements (f31, f32and f33) arrive in a similar order. In the in7AIn the case shown, an impulse associated with a feature element arrives in a sub time window or time slot. The time window is divided into the sub time windows to individually and reliably perform the detection of the pulses associated with different feature elements or the detection of different feature elements developed and represented on a time basis in each sub time window. This becomes the possibility of changing a processing mode and an improved adaptability of the way in which these features are integrated (for example, switching between a mode in which all feature elements are to be detected and a mode in which a predetermined percentage of features is to capture) lead. For example, if an object to be detected or detected is a face, and searching for it or detecting eyes that are parts of the face are important, and high priority for the detection of eye muscles  In the case of a visual search for this purpose, the response selectivity for the feature element patterns forming an eye or the sensitivity for detecting a particular feature may be selectively increased by introducing a feedback connection from a higher-order feature detection layer. This makes it possible to perform the detection by giving a higher importance level to the low-order feature elements constituting a higher-order feature or pattern feature. If in advance, a setting is made such that the more important Characteristics associated with earlier pulses in which sub-time windows arrive, it becomes easier to attribute features with higher importance levels capture by using the weighting function values in the sub time windows to larger values set as those in the remaining subwindow windows become. The importance levels of the detection priorities of Features can gained through learning or defined in advance. Thus, if all that is necessary is the occurrence of an event in which a predetermined percentage of feature elements are detected, dividing the time window into the lower-time windows is almost meaningless. Only one time window may be sufficient for this purpose. Alternatively, the pulses associated with a plurality of (three in this case) different feature elements and arriving may be added up (see FIG7D). In other words, the pulses representing a plurality of feature elements (7D) or any number of feature elements are assigned to a single sub time window or time slot. In this case, reference is made7D, the pulses associated with the feature elements f21and f23, which support the detection of an acute angle section f11 ofa triangle, at a first lower-time window. Similarly, the pulses associated with feature elements f ""22""and f ""31"", which assist in detecting an acute angle section f ""12""arrive at a second downtime window. The Number of subdivisions into the sub time windows or time slots, the width of the respective sub time window or time slots, the Classes of characteristics and the assignment of time intervals to the characteristics associated pulses are natural not limited to the above, so they are changed can. For example, you can additionally for the feature elements described above, the sub time windows for feature elements, such as ""X"" and ""+"". Such feature elements can for the graphical detection of a triangle redundant or unnecessary. On the other hand leads detecting the absence of such feature elements for higher accuracy the capture of a graphic pattern of a triangle. Even if a change not represented by a combination of the above feature elements is added, such as a case where rotation is added within a predetermined range, the pulses layered by the neurons of the feature integration have the previous ones Feature elements represent output continuous phase delays based on the degrees of deviations from an ideal pattern known as ""dainty degradation"". The range of phase delay amounts in this case is such that the pulses arrive at predetermined sub-time windows or time slots. Therefore, the outputs can be stabilized so that the allowable range for the changes in the graphic features to be detected stays at a predetermined level or higher. For example, with reference to FIG7C, a triangle Q1 formed by the features corresponding to the features f11, f12and f13, and a triangle Q 2 formed by the features corresponding to the features f41, f42and f43, at least in FIG their orientations differ from each other. In this case, if detection or integration cells associated with the features exist, then for a triangle Q3 oriented midway between the above two triangles, the detection or integration cells associated with f11, f12and f13 will beassigned , and the detection or integration cells associated with f41, f42,and f43both have output levels lower than a maximum response output level, and are based directly on a calculated value of a convolution with a filter kernel provides a receive field structure that depends on the type of feature. The vector sizes of the outputs of all these cells are integrated as the intrinsic factors of an intermediate graphic figure, so that it becomes possible to detect a graphic having a forum centered on the two triangles as a result of a rotation. Qualitatively, for example, as the rotation angle is decreased, which causes the intermediate graphics figure to be closer to Q1, the outputs from the cells associated with f11, f12,and f13are relatively increased. As the intermediate graphic figure approaches Q2, the outputs from f41, f42and f43 areassigned  Cells relatively increased. Spatio-temporal integration of pulse outputs and network features The following will describe the calculation of the spatio-temporal weighted sum of input pulses. As in7B1, each neuron calculates the weighted sum of input pulses using a predetermined weighting function (eg, Gaussian) for each sub-time window or slot, and compares the total sum of individual weighted sums with a threshold. The reference symbol τjdenotes the center position of the weighting function of a sub-time window j, and is measured from the start time of a time window as a reference, that is, by the time elapsed since the initial time. Generally, the weighting function may be a function of the distance from the predetermined center position, that is, the deviation on a time basis. The center position here indicates a pulse arrival time when a feature whose detection is expected has been found. The function may alternatively be an asymmetric function. When the weighting function is the aforesaid distance function, when the center position τ of the weighting function of each sub-period window or time slot of a neuron denotes a time lag after learning among neurons, a neural network calculating the spatially-temporally weighted sum of input pulses may be used as a radial base function network (hereinafter referred to as RBF ) of a type of the time base region. A time window Fτi ofa neuron niwhich uses a Gaussian function as the weighting function is given in accordance with the following expression when the size in each sub-time window is designated as σ, and a coefficient factor is designated as bij: The weighting function can assume a negative value. For example, if a neuron of a particular feature detection layer is expected to eventually detect a triangle, then if a feature F isfalse, such as ""X"" or ""+,"" which obviously is not part of a graphical pattern of the triangle, is detected, a weighting function and a connection from a Merkmalerfassungs- or feature-integrating cell, which make a negative contribution, from the pulse which isincorrectlyassigned to the feature F, and will be awarded after calculating the total sum value of inputs, so that a final detection output of the Triangle is not delivered even if there is a large contribution from another feature element. A spatio-temporal sum Xi(t) of an input signal supplied to the neuron ni ofthe feature detection layer is given by:wherein εjdenotes an initial phase of an output pulse from the neuron nj.This initial phase εjmay be converged to zero by the firing synchronized with that of the neuron ni, or εjmay always be set to zero if the time window is forcibly synchronized by supplying a timing pulse from a pacemaker neuron. Obtaining the weighted sum based on the in7Ashown pulse inputs and the in7Bweighting functions shown provides the temporal transition of weighted summation values, as in7Eis shown. When the weighted sum value reaches a threshold value Vt, the detection neuron outputs a pulse. As mentioned above, the output pulse signal from the neuron nihaving a learning-time delay (phase) to an upper-layer neuron at an output level is based on a squeezing nonlinear function of a spatio-temporal sum (""sum of inputs"") of the input signals fed. The pulse output assumes a binary fixed frequency, and at the time of output, a phase modulation amount based on the squeezing nonlinear function for the spatio-temporal sum of input signals is added to the phase equivalent to a learning delay determined fixed amount of delay. Implemented through layers processing procedure 8thFig. 10 is a flowchart illustrating the processing procedure of each layer described above. The flowchart summarizes the flow of processing from the acquisition of low-order features to the acquisition of high-order features. First, in step S801, a layer performs the detection of low-order features, including calculating a Gabor wave-let transform coefficient at each position. Then, in step S802, the layer performs the integration processing of the low-order features, such as local averaging of the features. The layer detects and integrates middle-order features in steps S803 and S804, and then detects and integrates higher-order features in steps S805 and S806. In step S807, an output regarding whether an object to be recognized or detected, or an output regarding the detected position of the object is provided as the output of the last layer. The number of layers assigned to steps S803 and S804, and S805 and S806 may be arbitrarily set or changed in accordance with an object such as an object to be recognized. 9Fig. 10 is a flowchart showing the procedure of processing performed by each of the feature detection neurons602is implemented. First, in step S901, the feature detection neuron receives pulses associated with a plurality of feature categories from a neuron601that the reception field105in an input layer101or a feature integration layer103which is the preceding layer forms. In step S902, the neuron generates602a time window and a weighting function based on a local synchronization signal generated by a pacemaker neuron603was received or obtained via the interaction with neurons in the preceding layer. In step S903, the neuron obtains a weighted sum based on a predetermined temporal weighting function. In step S904, the neuron detects602Whether a threshold has been reached, and if the determination result is affirmative, then the neuron gives602in step S905, a pulse. Steps S902 and 903 are shown serially in the flowchart, while in reality they are implemented at substantially the same time. The procedure of processing implemented by each feature integration neuron is as by the flowchart of FIG10shown. In step S1001, the feature integration neuron receives a pulse input from a feature detection neuron, which is a processing module104for detecting features of the same category and providing a local receive field intrinsic to the neuron. In step S1002, the feature integration neuron adds input pulses for a predetermined time width, which means a time range other than a refractory period. In step S1003, the feature detection neuron determines whether the total sum value of the input pulses, which can be measured based on, for example, a potential, has reached a threshold, and if the determination result is affirmative, then the neuron gives a pulse in one phase based on the Grand total. Modification examples of the network and the configuration The Input pulses become the features at individual positions in a spatial Area or a spatial assigned dispositional relationship of feature elements, which allows that a spatio-temporal RBF is formed. Around to put it more precisely, neuronal output values are weighted before they are added to make it possible to do a spatio-temporal Function of a pulse pattern for a any graphic pattern using a set of one big enough Number of feature elements or feature detection cells to represent, which is created in advance, and a weighted grand total in a sufficiently large Number of subwindows or time slots. If the category of an object to be recognized and the changes in the form of the object can be limited to a certain extent, then the required Number of feature detection cells or sub time windows or time slots be reduced. In the present embodiment the common buses use local bus lines such that a bus line is assigned to a reception field; the common Bus is not limited to this. Alternatively, pulse phase delay amounts can be separated be set on a timebase, so that an inter-layer connection from one layer to another layer using a individual bus line can be achieved. Furthermore, a common Bus line for adjacent reception fields are used, the relatively large sections have the same overlap each other. Instead of of using the spatially temporal RBF described above may be one Processing or threshold processing are carried out in such a way that the calculation result of the weighted sum in respective Subwindows or time slots to a nonlinear squeeze function value so that the product of the same can be obtained. For example can be done using a circuit configuration (not shown) obtained a threshold processing result (binary) for each sub time window and temporarily be stored in a memory. The logical products of Threshold processing results obtained in sequence may be a time-series manner can be obtained. If the products of the results of threshold processing, will the tolerance of detection of features should be smaller, if one Pattern is missing or its protruding is low. The processing discussed above for detecting a graphic Pattern using spatiotemporal RBF may alternatively be comparable in the form of an operation achieved to a recall process of an associative memory become. More specifically It is also when one in a local area or a whole Region to be detected feature element of a low or a middle order is missing, possible, to make an arrangement such that the entire spatio-temporal RBF network Feature elements of medium or high order recorded and the appropriate Fires neurons if some other feature elements are detected and the previous total of the expression (8) exceeds a threshold. The configuration of the network is not on the in1One shown limited. Obviously, MLP or other alternative may be used as long as it includes a layer for detecting predetermined geometrical feature elements. Example of the application an image forming apparatus 11FIG. 11 shows an image forming apparatus incorporating the pattern detecting or pattern recognition apparatus having the configuration of the present embodiment. The following will describe an operation for focusing on a particular object, performing color corrections of the particular object, and controlling the exposure.11Fig. 10 illustrates the configuration of an example in which the pattern recognition or pattern detecting apparatus according to the embodiment is used with the image forming apparatus. An in11shown image forming apparatus1101is primarily with an imaging optical system1102equipped with a taking lens and a zoom photography driving controller, a CCD or CMOS image sensor1103, an image parameter measuring circuit1104an image signal processing circuit1105, a store1106, a control signal generator1107for generating control signals for controlling an imaging operation, control of imaging conditions, etc., a display1108which also serves as a viewfinder, such as an electronic view finder; EVF, a flash unit1109, and a recording medium1110includes. The imaging device1101Further, with the above-mentioned pattern detection or pattern recognition apparatus, it is an object detection or object recognition apparatus1111Mistake. The imaging device1101uses the object detection or object recognition device1111for example, to detect the position and size of a face image of a person who has been registered in advance from recorded images. Then, the information regarding the position and the size of the face of the person from the object detection or the object recognition device111to the control signal generator1107delivered. The control signal generator1107generates control signals for optimally performing the focus control, the exposure condition control, the white balance control, etc. for the person based on the outputs of the imaging parameter measuring unit1104, The Use of the aforesaid pattern detection or pattern recognition device with the imaging device allows the detection of a Person and optimal control of imaging based on Detection results, low-power and with to achieve a high speed in real time. <Second Embodiment> In the first embodiment, synapses have been configured to phase modulate  To run. In this embodiment, recognition of a graphic pattern or the like is performed by using a network composed of synapse elements which modulate pulse widths in analog values and integration-and-fire neurons shown in the first embodiment in FIG1shown network configuration. The modulation by a synapse is expressed by Wa= SijWbwhen the pulse width of a postsynaptic signal is expressed as Wa. In this case, Sij means thesame as the connection strength in Expression (5) of the first embodiment. To achieve a wide dynamic range for the modulation, the basic pulse width of a pulse signal must be set to a value sufficiently smaller than the period, ie a basic pulse interval. One Neuron fires a pulse or spends it when its potential because of due to the influx of a plurality of pulse streams, the represent predetermined feature elements, accumulated charges exceeds a predetermined threshold. This embodiment need not particularly the weighted addition of arrived pulses for each Unterzeitfenster, which described in the first embodiment but implements an integration in a time window with a predetermined width. In this case, a feature element to be detected hangs or graphic pattern solely of an entire temporal Sum of the signals received from a neuron in a feature detection layer, d. H. the total sum of pulse current values. The ratio of Pulse width between input and Output pulses is equivalent to the value of the weighting function in the first embodiment. If the weighted addition of the received pulses for each Sub-time window performed will be information regarding the presence or transformation of a detected feature in the time intervals of incoming pulses or in the arrival time pattern represents yourself, as in the case of the first embodiment. The Output feature of a feature acquisition layer neuron may be such be set that the frequency increases, or such that the pulse width or the amplitude with increasing degree of sticking out (see the first embodiment) an applicable characteristic increases. 12Ashows a configuration unit of a synapse element401used in this embodiment. A learning circuit402of the same kind as that in the first embodiment and a pulse width modulation circuit1201included. For the pulse width modulation circuit1201For example, a well known circuit such as that disclosed in the gazette of patent no. 2717662 by the present assignee can be used. Instead of performing the aforementioned pulse width modulation, a pulse frequency may be modulated at each synapse element. In this case, the configuration of the synapse element includes401that corresponds to the above configuration, the learning circuit402and a pulse frequency modulation circuit1202, as in12Bis shown. A known configuration can be applied to the pulse frequency modulation circuit1202be applied. The modulation by the synapse is expressed by fa= Sijfbwhen the presynaptic pulse frequency is designated as fb, and the postsynaptic pulse frequency is designated as fa. It Needless to say that the pulse modulation circuit or the like is equipped with a control device that up to a upper limit, d. H. one pulse cycle, saturates at a maximum Pulse width, if a neuron output frequency modulation or a pulse width modulation involved. <Third Embodiment> The in this embodiment feature acquisition neurons are designed to be graphical Characteristics and their deformation based on the time intervals in analog values and the orders of pulse intervals or graphical features based on importance levels which will be described below. The network configuration used in this embodiment is the same as that in FIG1with the exception that each interlayer synapse connection is given a phase offset based on the location in a receive field.13Fig. 10 shows a scanning structure in the reception field of a feature detection neuron used in this embodiment. For example, if the receive field is elliptical, as in13is shown, then the scanning structure is configured such that the  Phase modulation amounts at grid points (S1, S2, ...) that are scanned spirally from the center position of the ellipse, slowly increase. The phase modulation amount at an arbitrary point is defined as the phase modulation amount at the closest lattice point to that point. 14shows an example of the phase modulation amount based on a location in the reception field of a feature element. Consequently, the phase modulation amounts (p1, p2, ...) are added based on the locations in the reception field within the modulation range of the sub-time window area to which an associated feature should belong, which allows the information relating to the arrays of features from the locations in the individual sub time windows or signal trains. It is needless to say that the scanning can be performed in a pattern other than the spiral pattern. It It is assumed that the weighted addition using the Time window functions in neurons (as in the first embodiment described) or the temporal integration in a predetermined Time window of a pulse width modulation signal (as in the second embodiment described) and that each feature element is its associated under-time window Has. Consequently, the position of a signal peak in each Unterzeitfenster the spatial Position of a feature element in the same Emp starting field, which it is the temporal interval pattern of a plurality of signal peaks allows the arrangement of feature elements or graphic patterns to represent high order. In addition, the Window functions based on importance levels or be assigned to the phase modulation. The importance level in This case refers to an ""outstanding"" feature element or a graphical one Pattern, which is the distinction of a to be detected or to be recognized Pattern opposite facilitates different patterns, and is different for each pattern category. This is gained empirically through learning. The importance levels can for example, by updating parameters in directions for improved reliability be obtained in the detection or detection when the interference a parameter that greatly contributes to the capture of a particular feature rated by, for example, increasing of the sub time window function value or by changing the phase modulation amount of one associated feature is provided. In explained above embodiments the method has been described in which a signal spike train, that of a plurality of different features from the receiving field is assigned to represent, Capture or recognize two-dimensional pattern information is used. Feature elements or graphical elements lower or high order are determined by threshold processing weighted sum in a time window of a pulse train detected. This makes it possible desired Patterns also reliable to detect when there is an object to be detected or recognized due to a positional change, a rotation, etc. deformed or an inadequacy in the detection a feature due to the effects of lighting, noise or the like occurs under complicated, diverse conditions. This advantage can be without the need of resorting be obtained on any particular network structure. In addition, can implemented a ""context-dependent"" processing be inclusive the processing, which is to be an object to be detected or recognized Object around existing pattern is adapted to the processing for lending priority to a particular section of a subject to be detected or recognized Object, and the processing steps to deal with a case, in which a pattern that should not be detected has been detected is. About that It is also possible an arrangement for implementing a faster detection or Identification of more familiar patterns to meet. If a feature has been detected, may be from the arrival of a pulse (digital information) from a predetermined neuron in a predetermined one Time range are detected. The degree of deviation in the form the deformation opposite An ideal pattern of the feature is explicitly represented in a network by analog information including a pulse delay amount Pulse width, and a frequency. This arrangement makes it possible, the Accuracy to distinguish highly similar patterns and those for processing dramatically improve required time. In addition, in accordance with the above-described configurations, the pulses of a pulse train timed on a single input line of a predetermined neuron are positioned in a time window so as to correspond to the characteristics of a predetermined pattern. With this arrangement, the difficulties of wiring between neuron elements can be circumvented  and the circuit size and power consumption for recognizing or detecting a predetermined object by the two-dimensional pattern processing can be significantly reduced as compared with the prior art while maintaining high reliability. In accordance with the pattern detecting device described above a desired one Patterns also reliable be detected if an inadequacy or the like of features of an object to be detected occurs. Furthermore can the accuracy of the distinction between patterns of high similarity and the one for that required time dramatically improved. <Fourth Embodiment> This embodiment will capture or recognize patterns without relying on scales. The following will describe the aspects different from those discussed above embodiments differ. General configuration The general configuration of the pattern detection or pattern recognition apparatus according to the fourth embodiment is identical to that in FIG1shown. In this embodiment, the form in1the feature detection layers (1, 0), (1, 1), ... and the feature integration layers (2, 0), (2, 1), ... a set of processing channels at a plurality of resolutions or scale levels as a whole. Each processing channel implements processing at a scale level or resolution for detecting and recognizing low-to-high order features by hierarchical processing. Each layer has a plurality of circuit elements belonging to different processing channels, the circuit elements being arranged in a predetermined layout. Now on the in15and in16Referring to the examples shown, the configuration of the processing channels will be described in connection with the feature integration layer (2, 0). Both in15and16Examples shown form a processing channel with a subsequent layer if the scale level or the resolution are the same.15FIG. 12 shows the feature integration cells arranged close to each other because they share the same feature category (a directed component in this case) although they belong to different processing channels.16FIG. 12 shows the feature integration layers arranged close to each other because they share the same scale level, ie the same processing channel, although they handle different feature categories. The functional differences of the above configurations will be explained later. In a feature integration layer (2, 0), each circuit element receives Gabor wavelet transform features as low-order features, which will be explained later, from the cells of a feature detection layer (1, 0). Generally are feature detection cells in a feature detection layer (1, k), where ""k"" indicates a natural number the the outputs of a variety of feature integration cells receive the same channel in the previous layer (2, k - 1) configured to belong to the channel. The Feature integration layer (2, 0) on a What path has a predetermined Receive field structure, and is formed of neuron elements, the pulse trains produce. The feature integration layer (2, 0) integrates one Variety of neuron element outputs in the same receive field of the feature detection layer (1, 0) by a sub-scan, the is performed by local averaging or the like, and by performing a calculation for combining the processing results different scale levels. The neurons in the feature integration layer have a common structure for their reception fields together, as long as the same feature category and the same scale level are affected. Feature integration layers (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, N) have predetermined reception field structures obtained by learning. As in the case of the above-described layers, the layers ((1, 1), ...) detect a plurality of different features in each feature detection module, and  the later layers ((2, 1), ...) integrate the detection results on a plurality of features received from the feature detection layers in the preceding stages. The feature detection layers are connected or wired to receive cell element outputs of the feature integration layers in the preceding stages belonging to the same channels. The feature detection layers perform two types of processing. A Type of processing is subsampling. The subsampling process mediates primarily the outputs from a local region (a local receive field a suitable feature integration layer neuron) of a feature detection cell population the same feature category and the same scale level. The other Type of processing is the integration of the results of processing at different scale levels. This processing combines the outputs of a plurality of feature detection cell populations the same feature category, but in a variety of different ways Scale levels, linear or nonlinear. One Where path with feature position detection layers ((3, 0), ... (3, k)) the input of predetermined feature integration layers (not necessarily all feature integration layers) on the what path and is lower in outputting the positions of features, middle and high order involved. In the following descriptions will be a more detailed explanation of each layer on the Wo path omitted. Processing by feature acquisition layers Each neuron of the feature detection layer (1, 0) has a reception field structure based on gmn. If gmn has thesame scale index m, its reception field is also of the same size. In the calculation, an assigned kernelgmnsize is based on the same scale index. In this example, the sizes of 30x30, 15x15 and 7x7 are set on an input image, starting with the coarsest scale or the coarsest scale. each Neuron outputs pulses with an output level which is a non-linear one Squeeze function of a wavelet transform coefficient value by entering the sum of products of a distribution weighting factor was obtained with image data. In this embodiment, a phase to represent used by output information; however, alternatively one may Frequency, amplitude or pulse width used as a reference become. Thus, the Gabor wavelet transform became expression (4) performed, to get the output of the entire layer (1, 0). The number of sampling points, that is, the number of positions where the feature detection or the like is performed is set to be the same for each scale level. Therefore, the features at individual points or locations extracted by the Gabor wavelet transform are schematically represented by the in25represents a hierarchical structure having different representative ranges for different scale levels. The representative areas represent input data areas in which a feature can be detected at each representative point. Multiple representations of features at a plurality of scale levels are obtained at each position in an image for the population coding process to produce a correspondence to optional scale levels, which will be discussed later. The circles (O) in25specify the corresponding point in input data at each scale level. Different as the neurons of the acquisition layers, the neurons of the following feature detection layers ((1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, N)) the receive field structures for detecting for unique features recognizing pattern using the Hebb learning rule or similar. In a later Layer approaches the size of a local region to capture a feature slowly the size of the recognizing object, so that later layers in the hierarchy geometrically detect features of medium or high order. To the Examples relate to the detection or recognition of a face Medium or high order features on the feature at the level of graphical elements, such as the eyes, the nose and the mouth that make up the face. Different processing channels that share an identical hierarchical level, ie an identical level of complexity of a feature to be detected, capture features that belong to the same category at different scales. For example, ""eyes"" defined as medium-order features are detected by different features as ""eyes"" of different sizes. In other words, the detection is performed in a plurality of processing channels of different scales  veau selectivities for the ""eyes"" of the given size performed in a picture. The neurons of the feature detection layer may have a mechanism for receiving inhibitory connections (the short-circuit inhibition type) of outputs of a layer in the preceding stage to ensure stable outputs. Processing at feature integration layers Now, the neurons of the feature integration layers become103((2, 0), (2, 1), ...). As in1is the connection from the feature detection layer102(For example, (1, 0)) to the feature integration layer103(For example, (2, 0) is configured such that input of a stimulating connection from a neuron of the same feature element or type of a feature detection layer in the preceding stage is received in the reception field of the feature integration neuron There are two types of feature integration layer neurons103that is subsampling neurons and population coding neurons. The subsampling neurons perform sub-sampling by local averaging such as calculating an average, representative value or maximum value of inputs of neurons forming the reception field of the feature detection neuron for each feature category as described above. The population coding neurons connect outputs related to the features of the same category over different scales or processing channels. In accordance with the above, the impulses that a variety of Characteristics of the same class are assigned, fed, and the pulse inputs are integrated into a local region and averaged, or becomes a receive field, or a representative Value, such as calculating a maximum value in a receive field. This allows a reliable Capture a feature even if the position of the feature fluctuates or deformation occurs. Therefore, the Receive fields of the feature integration neurons independent of the categories or characteristics have the same structure. For example can Receive fields composed of rectangular regions of a predetermined size be and evenly distributed in it Have sensitivity or weighting coefficients. Related to population coding to the scale level The mechanism of population coding performed by the latter type of neurons will be explained in detail. The population coding neurons perform integration by performing a normalized linear coupling of the outputs from a plurality of sub-sampling neurons that are at the same hierarchical level (ie, the complexity of a graphical feature is approximately at the same level) but belonging to different processing channels for the same feature, and exist in the same feature integration layer. For example, the feature integration layer (2, 0) which receives the outputs of the Garba wavelet transforming feature detection layer (1, 0) integrates by linear combination or the like the outputs corresponding to a set {gmn} (n is constant , and m = 1, 2, ...) of Gabor filters associated with different processing channels but having the same directional sensitivity. To be more specific, an output pij(t) of a subsampling neuron having a directional component selectivity and a scale selectivity j, and a population code qij(t) having the same selectivity by an expression (9) representing the linear combination of normalized outputs of the sub-scan neuron and represents an expression (10) indicating a normalization scheme therefor. For the sake of simplicity of explanation, the output state transition of the subsampling neuron and the population coding neuron is expressed as a discrete time transition.where wij, abdenotes a coupling coefficient corresponding to that of a neuron or a neuron popu  tion, which has a variety of different selectivities or sensitivity characteristics. The contribution of the output of a subsampling neuron having a feature category, that is, a directional component selectivity index ""a"" and a scale level selectivity index ""b"", is supplied to a population coding neuron having a directional component selectivity index ""i"" and a scale level selectivity index ""j"". The wij, abdenotes a filtering function or selectivity based primarily on the direction component index ""i"" and the scale level index ""j"", and typically takes the form of the function of | i-a | and | j - b | as follows: wij, ab= f (| i-a |, | j-b |). As will be discussed later, the population coding based on the linear coupling over the mediator wij, abfor qij isintended to confer a likelihood of existence in terms of feature category or directional component and a scale level, taking into account the detection levels of neurons other selectivities. The parameter C denotes a normalization constant, and λ and β denote constants. Typically, β is 1 or 2. Setting β to 2 provides an effect of compressing and reducing the contribution of low level noise components when β is set to 1. C denotes a constant for preventing pij fromdiverging even if the total of population codes for a particular feature category is close to zero. In an initial state, when a system is powered up, qij(0) = pij(0). Combined with15the addition is performed only on the scale level selectivity index in expressions (9) and (10). As a result, the population coding neurons output the quantities in proportion to the probabilities of existence of respective features belonging to the same feature category but to different scale levels or processing channels. Furthermore, as in the in16In general, a system for implementing population coding, even at the middle level of a pre-set number of directional components, may be constructed by further adding the directional component selectivity index. In this case, by appropriately setting the parameters β and wij, lkin expressions (11) and (12) to be described below, it enables the in16configuration shown that the population coding neurons output the quantities proportional to the probabilities of the existence of the features for individual scale levels and in feature categories. As indicated by expression (9), the population code qij(t) is obtained by the normalized linear combination that deals with the outputs of neurons with the sensitivity at different scale levels. If a qij(t) that has reached a stable state is correctly normalized to set its value anywhere between 0 and 1, then qij will providea probability of the directional component i and the scale level j, assuming that the above correct normalization is achieved by, for example, using a grand total over qij. Accordingly, to explicitly determine the scale level associated with the size of an object in input data, a curve for fitting qij isdetermined to estimate the maximum value, and the scale level is determined based thereon. The scale level thus obtained generally indicates an intermediate value of preset scale levels. 26shows an example of the population coding of scale levels, where the abscissa axis indicates the scale level, while the ordinate axis indicates cell outputs. The issues correspond to impulse phases. A neuron that has its peak sensitivity at a particular scale will show a drop in its output level or a phase lag for a feature of a size that deviates from that particular scale as compared to a feature of the size corresponding to that particular scale , 26Figure 12 shows the sensitivity curves or ""tuning curves"" for the scale sensitivities of individual feature detection cells, cell outputs, and integrated, population encoded outputs or moments related to the scale levels of cell outputs, ie, linear sums. The positions of the integrated population encoded outputs on the abscissa axis reflect the assumed values of the scale or scale or size of an object to be detected. In fact, in this embodiment, the scale levels are not explicitly determined, and the outputs from a feature integration layer to a feature detection layer are designated qij. In this case, alternatively, a normalized qijmay be used. More specifically, in both15as well as16the outputs from the feature integration layer103to the feature factors  sungsschicht102rather, the outputs of population coding neurons than those of subsampling neurons. Consequently, the outputs are ultimately collectively represented in the form of a detection probability of a particular object covering a plurality of scale levels or resolutions like the normalized qij. In accordance with the circuit configuration of in15feature integration layer shown103are in a subsampling neuron circuit1501among the preceding-stage feature detection layer neuron outputs, the neuron outputs that share the same feature categories and size selectivities first receive from the local receive fields of the sub-scan neurons to perform local averaging. The subsampling neuron outputs are sent to a coupling circuit103Posted. At this time, as will be discussed later, the pulse signal from each of the neurons is delayed by a predetermined phase amount (for example, an amount proportional to the square of the output level of a feature detection neuron) by a synapse circuit (not shown) if β from Expression (6) 2 is) and spread over a local shared bus. Alternatively, however, the neurons may be physically physically wired without using the common bus. The coupling circuit1503implements the processing based on the expressions (5) and (6) to perform population coding on the information belonging to the same feature category but having different size selectivities or involving a plurality of processing channels. In accordance with the in15In the circuit configuration shown, population coding was performed on subsampling neuron outputs of the same feature category (directional component selectivity). In contrast, in accordance with the in1612 shows the processing based on the following expressions (11) and (12) by the coupling circuit1503which implements population coding on subsampling neuron outputs over entire feature categories and size selectivities.  Now, the method of calculating the scale level of an object to be recognized will be described. The implementation of the above processing allows the calculation of the scale level of the object to be recognized based on a mean activity level or sub-sampling neuron output level Pa ofeach processing channel. An estimated scale level S is represented as follows, for example:where Padenotes the average activity level of a processing channel ""a"", Sadenotes the scale level or scale index of the processing channel ""a"", and piadenotes the activity level of a sub-sampling neuron belonging to the processing channel ""a"". The average activity level Pamay be used, for processing in the subsequent layer, to control the activity levels of the neurons in each processing channel. For example, Pamay be used to generate a signal to control a neuron fire threshold in the subsequent layer. In this case, the fire thresholds of the  subsequent layers are reduced to effectively increase a feature detection sensitivity for the channel with a maximum level of Pa, while the fire thresholds of the subsequent layers are increased, to effectively reduce the feature detection sensitivity for the remaining channels. This allows to activate only the channel or the scale level with the maximum Pa, thereby making it possible to achieve a reduced power consumption and a robust noise immune processing. In addition, the thresholds of the subsequent layers are controlled based on the value of Paby decreasing the thresholds for channels having relatively higher Pavalues. This arrangement makes it possible to perform adaptive control of the feature detection sensitivity on the basis of a mean channel activity level in the step of extracting low-order features. In addition, it is also possible to provide a channel activation control circuit which processes the output signals of each population coding neuron by amplifying or attenuating the signals, ie, advancing or delaying pulse phases thereof, on the basis of Pafor each channel in the layer (2, 0) ,18shows a configuration of such a channel activation control circuit. A channel activation control circuit1802is between the population coding neurons and the subsequent layers, that is, those in the15and16The feature detection layer is provided and receives the processing results of a center activity calculation circuit1801which processes the outputs of the population coding neurons. In the last layer is over a variety of channels, the probability of the existence of one as a feature higher Order to be recognized object in the form of the activity level represents a neuron, the activity level primary based on a firing frequency or the phase of a fire impulse spike. In a Wo processing path, or if the information regarding the Position of the object to be detected or detected as well in the last layer is captured, the probability the existence of the object based on the position or the object Location in input data in terms of activity level every neuron in the last layer is captured. In this case will the probability of the existence of the object due to the presence Replaces the object if threshold processing is implemented becomes. The Population coding could performed by linear coupling which does not involve normalization; this would, however to sensitivity to Cause noise. Therefore, it is preferable to perform normalization. The Normalization shown in Expression (10) and (12) can be confirmed by the ""short circuit inhibition"" at the level of neural network. The ones shown in Expression (9) and (11) Linear coupling can be achieved by a lateral interconnection become. An example of a normalization circuit for β equal to 2 is in FIG17shown. The normalization circuit is implemented by a sum-of-squares calculation circuit1703for determining the sum of squares of the outputs of featuredetection cellsnijbelonging to different processing channels, a short-circuit inhibiting circuit1704for primary normalizing the expression (10), and a linear sum circuit1705for determining and outputting the linear sum of the expression (9). The sum-of-squares calculation circuit1703has an intermediate neuron circuit1,706for summarizing the squared values of feature detection cells, and a synaptic connection element1702for applying a connection to the intermediate neuron circuit1,706gives a pulse phase delay, a pulse width modulation or a pulse frequency modulation equivalent to the square value of an output of the feature detection neuron element1701, The short-circuit inhibiting circuit1704For example, by a variable resistance element (and a capacitor) that is proportional to the inverse number of one by multiplying an output of the intermediate neuron circuit1,706with a predetermined coefficient (λ / C), a capacitor and a pulse phase modulation circuit (or a pulse width modulation circuit or a pulse frequency modulation circuit) which is the square of the output of the feature detection neuron element1701supplies, formed. Now, a modification example of the channel processing will be described. There is an alternative to the aforementioned configuration in which population coding is performed for each processing channel, and the output of each processing channel is transmitted to a subsequent layer (ie, the configuration in which the in15or16shown configuration in the manner of a cascade in subsequent Schich  is continued). In the alternative configuration, the outputs of the population coding neurons are forwarded only to the subsequent layer feature detection cells belonging to the same channel as the processing channel, thereby imparting a maximum response level in the feature integration layer (2, 0) to improve processing efficiency and power consumption to reduce. In this case, a maximum input detection circuit, that is, a so-called ""winner-take-all circuit"" (hereinafter referred to as ""WTA-take-all"") is connected between the outputs of the feature integration layer (2, 0 ) and the subsequent feature detection layer (1, 1) in addition to the one in15or16shown configuration provided. The WTA circuit acts as a processing channel selection circuit which receives the outputs of the population coding neuron circuit and gives a maximum response level. The processing channel selection circuit may be provided for each position of the feature integration layer. Alternatively, such a processing channel selection circuit may be provided for this layer to calculate a maximum response level for each processing channel over the entire input data regardless of locations. For the WTA circuit, a known configuration may be used, such as those disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 08-321747, US Patent 5059814, or US Patent 5,146,106.19AFig. 12 schematically shows the configuration in which the outputs of only the maximum responses in processing-feature layer indicating processing channels are forwarded by the WTA circuit to a feature detection layer (the subsequent layer) in the feature integration layer. This circuit configuration is identical to that in18One with the exception that the channel activation control circuit1802from18by a gate circuit1902has been replaced. As in19Bis shown, the gate circuit1902a WTA circuit1603which receives a middle output level for each processing channel, and a channel selection circuit1604for forwarding the output of each neuron from a maximum mean output level indicating processing channel to the same channel of the next layer. In a subsequent feature integration layer (2, k), where k is 1 or greater, such a processing channel selection circuit is dispensable. For example, an output of a feature integration layer after a high-order feature is detected may be fed back through the processing channel selection circuit to select a processing channel in a low- or middle-order feature integration layer. This completes the explanation of the modification example of the channel processing. The configuration is not on the in15or161, in which the processing steps of sub-sampling, coupling, and population coding are implemented in the feature integration layer. Alternatively, for example, separate layers may be provided for processing for population coding and processing, respectively. The The advantages described below are achieved by performing the Population coding over the Outputs from the same kind of feature category capture neurons obtained different scale levels. An accurate detection or detection can be achieved even if the size of a Object corresponds to a scale level that is different from any one different from preset scale levels and somewhere between this lies. Furthermore makes multi-scale hierarchical parallel processing possible, one stable detection or detection of an object by correctly selecting a Reach variety of scale levels or resolutions even then if an object of a different size in a neighborhood or on an overlapping Way exists. About that It is not longer necessary, models corresponding to an enormous number of templates or to create templates for handling objects of random sizes, allowing processing using fewer scale levels can be implemented. In addition, can in accordance with the embodiment, in which the processing channels are spatially separated and up to the last layer, the population coding, including the processing of the connection between processing channels, without the need for complicated timing is carried out compared to the configurations where the processing channels on one Time base are used, as in a fifth and a sixth embodiment, which will be described below will be shown. There is another advantage obtained due to the configuration in which the differences between the processing channels in the Form of the fire characteristic of physically different neurons be issued. This allows the detection or detection processing at the same time at a variety of scales, in Comparison with a case in which the processing of individual Scale levels is implemented in a time series. Even if another object of a nearly identical size in one Neighborhood or on an overlapping Way exists, of course, the performance becomes Recognizing or detecting a to be recognized or to be detected Maintaining object due to the mechanism fitted to it is, a variety of types of partial features through the local receive field structure, subsampling structure, etc. The Pulse coding and the detection method for two-dimensional graphic Patterns are the same as those of the first embodiment, so the explanation the same is not repeated. Pulse signal processing by the feature integration layer In the aforementioned coupling circuit, the pulses associated with the population coding levels obtained by expression (9) or (11) are supplied to the individual population coding neurons and designated as the output cells (n1, n2,and n3) of the (2, k Numbered feature integration layer acting population coding neurons receive the pulse inputs from the pacemaker neurons of a (1, k + 1) numbered layer. Then, the population coding neurons output output pulses, using the falling edges of the pulses from the pacing neurons as their rezincurrents, if the outputs of the coupling circuit due to the inputs from a feature detection layer or a sensor input layer numbered (1, k) in the preceding layer are sufficient high levels. The sufficiently high levels here mean, for example, that the average number of input pulses in a predetermined time range or time window is greater than a threshold, or that pulse phases are leading. The Sub-sampling neurons described above do not become the controller undergone by any of the pacemaker neurons, and carry one Sub-sampling based on a mean output level or level from the feature detection cells of the layer (1, k) the previous stage. The mean output level relates to the level of the level received in a time window Outputs with one independent phase for each Unterabtastneuron. The control of the times for issuing Pulses from the subsampling neurons to the coupling circuit is performed without the intermediation of pacemaker neurons. The same thing applies to the pulses from the coupling circuit to the population coding neurons be issued. consequently are in agreement with the present embodiment the feature integration cells, such as the sub-scanning neurons and the population coding neurons, not adapted to the timing control by the pacemaker neurons on their preceding feature numbering layer numbered (1, k) to be set. This is because the dates for Generating the time windows are not very important because the feature integration cells Pulses in phases (used in this embodiment Phases can arbitrarily replaced by frequencies, pulse widths and amplitudes are output), which are determined by the input levels, the with regard to the temporal integration values of input pulses or the like in a predetermined time range instead of one dependence from an input pulse arrival time pattern. This should not be seen as excluding the configuration in which the feature integration cells are the timing controller from pacemaker neurons of a feature detection layer in FIG received previous layer. The point is, the possibility to suggest such a configuration. It is also possible to achieve a learning control covering a plurality of scales or processing channels simply by presenting an object to be recognized or detected in a size during a learning mode. To be more specific, during learning mode, the in18The channel activation control circuit shown is controlled so as to distribute the outputs of a channel having the highest average activity level among the outputs in the feature integration layer (2, 0) to the remaining channels, and then the above-described learning is performed. For example, if it is assumed that a learning rule is prepared in advance to use the same pulse intervals or the same arrival time pattern for different processing channels with respect to the same feature category, then the outputs of the feature integration layer neurons of the channel with the highest average activity level are distributed and sent to the neurons the feature detection layer (the next layer) of the following entire channels or channels close to the scale level of this channel in accordance with the reception field structures of the feature detection neurons  delivers (in the same pulse train pattern). The outputs are provided in the form of the same pulse train pattern. In this case, all the channels of the following layer are activated at the same level. Another method can be used to obtain the same result. consequently The same effect can be caused by a learning process on objects Received variety of different sizes or scale levels will be easily obtained in a learning process without the learning process by presenting different sizes of one to implement the object to be recognized or detected. The The following will be processing in a learning mode and a recognition mode describe that mainly in a feature detection layer. As described above, in each feature detection layer102Receive pulse signals associated with a plurality of different features from the same receive field, and the spatio-temporal weighted grand total and threshold processing are performed in a processing channel designated for each scale level. The feature-associated pulses arrive at predetermined time intervals based on delay amounts or phases preset by learning. The Learning control of the impulse arrival time pattern is not a major issue of the present application, leaving only a least possible description is given. For example, a competing learning program introduced, in which, when a graphic pattern forming a particular graphic pattern Feature element is a standout feature that matters the most the capture of the graphic pattern, this feature element first arrives, and the feature elements, their degrees of standout almost are the same, with predetermined time intervals provided therebetween arrive to distinguish feature elements by pulse signals. Alternatively, the learning control may be configured such that predefined feature elements which are the feature elements which form an object to be recognized and which are particularly important be considered (for example, a large mean curvature and a high degree of linearity), arrive at different time intervals. Of the Degree of salience is for example in the strength of Answer (the amount of pulse delay in this Embodiment) a cell for capturing feature elements when the graphic pattern is captured. In this case, the neurons, the low order feature elements in the same receive field on the feature integration layer (the layer in the previous stage) are assigned to fire synchronously or pulses in predetermined phases output. In general, when a neuron in the feature integration layer connects to a feature detection neuron for detecting the same higher order feature located at a different position (in this case, the neuron has a different reception field but has a connection to form the same feature high order), these neurons are synchronous. However, the output level also depends on a grand total or the like or the like of the contributions from a plurality of pacemaker neurons provided for each reception field of a feature detection neuron. The output level in this example is given by a phase; alternatively, however, frequencies, amplitudes or pulse widths may be used as a reference. In every neuron on the feature detection layer102the spatio-temporal weighted sum of input pulses is calculated over a pulse train that reaches the neuron only in a time window of a predetermined width. The means for performing the weighted addition in the time window is not the one in2shown neuron element circuit limited; another method can be used. In this embodiment became the Gabor wavelet transform for extracting features low order used. However, it is obvious that another multi-scale feature, such as a local one Autocorrelation coefficient, which is proportional to scales by size was obtained, can be used alternatively. As in the case of the first embodiment, installing the pattern-detecting or pattern-recognizing apparatus having the configuration according to the embodiment in an imaging apparatus such as FIG11shown, it is possible to focus on a particular object, perform color corrections of the particular object, and control the exposure. <Fifth Embodiment> In this embodiment become the representation of features at different scale levels and those above described population coding only on low-order features executed. A scale invariant representation of features is achieved by pulse phase modulation or the like on features, and features of medium or high order in the scale invariant feature representation area. More accurate expressed becomes the same structure up to the feature integration layer (2, 0) like that of the first embodiment and then becomes a scale invariant signal conversion on low-order features that characterizes this embodiment, carried out. Starting from a feature detection layer (1, 1) and after a feature capture of medium to high order and integration performed on scale invariant feature representation. With this arrangement can a simplified circuit configuration, a smaller circuit scale and a reduced power consumption can be achieved while at the same time a scale invariant recognition performance is maintained without to use the configuration, which has a variety of processing channels for features middle to high order, shown in the first embodiment, includes. 21shows a network configuration used in the fifth embodiment. More specifically, in a feature detection layer (1, k) wherein ""k"" is a natural number, features higher in order than the features obtained by the Gabor wavelet transform or the like and detected from a layer (1 , 0) were extracted. As in21however, it is possible to eliminate physical differences between processing channels in the circuit configuration starting from a layer (1, 1) and thereafter. Referring to21is detected in a layer (1, 0) Sk, m, and this indicates a feature category of a scale level m and a k-th feature category. Ck, mis integrated in a layer (2, 0), and this indicates a feature category of a scale level m and a k-th feature category. Starting with a shift (1, 1) and thereafter, no scale indices are added to the feature categories to be captured and integrated. 23shows the transition of signal trains. In order to obtain a scale-invariant representation of information by pulse phase modulation, once a phase transformation by an in21shown pulse phase converter2101is performed so that pulses from different processing channels are placed at different positions on a time base, and that pulse signals belonging to different processing channels are not mixed (cf.23A). Then scale-invariant pulse signal trains are generated by a scale-invariant signal converter2102and the pulse trains from the feature integration layer (2, 0) are caused to arrive at the neurons of the feature detection layer (1, 1). Around to be more precise, will be for the impulses, the same category of low-order categories, but different Scale level processing channels (hereinafter referred to as ""the same characteristic but different Scale ""), a learning rule, such as a self-organization or as mentioned above, or a self-organization of the phase delay amount so determined that the pulses with respect to a predetermined pulse interval pattern represents when they reach feature detection cells. For example is one in the case of the same feature of different scales Configuration designed such that the difference in the processing channel (different scaling property) when capturing Features of lower order than a pattern is represented, in the relationship the intervals of input pulses to the feature detection cells is identical, but the scaling in the time domain is different is, or is represented as a pattern in which the absolute values of Pulse intervals provide the phase offset values that are in accordance with scale levels as a result of a learning process. More specifically, in the earlier case, τ used in the learning rule of Expression (6) is given by the following formula in accordance with the scale level index m and the feature category index k. To simplify the explanation, the index representation of the time delay taken from the neuron j to the neuron i in expression (6) is omitted.τ (k, m) = αηkρm+ ξkm(15) In the latter case, τ is represented as follows:τ (k, m) = ηk+ αpm(16)where ηkindicates a size unique to a feature category, ρmindicates a size unique to a scale level, and α indicates a positive constant. In the above expressions, ρmindicates the expansion and contraction rate in the time domain, and ξkmindicates a phase offset, all of which are intrinsic in the scale level. Expression (15) includes the phase offset amount ξ for preventing different processing channel signals from being mixed on a time basis. Then generates a scale invariant signal converter2102a time-slot weighting function for a time range for a particular channel, that is, a scale level selected by a gating circuit (see FIG.23B), and performs a conversion into scale invariant pulse train information regarding the feature to be detected (cf.23C). Normally, only one pulse train associated with the feature category detected by a particular scale level or processing channel is extracted, and the pulse train is copied to undergo a predetermined conversion as needed. To be more specific, the gate is as in19shown used to extract a pulse train of a processing channel with the highest average activity level. For the former case, the pulse phase converter performs2101a pulse phase conversion to obtain the expansion and contraction ratio in the time domain which remains constant with respect to a reference value. For the latter case, the conversion is performed so that a phase offset amount in an arrival pattern of a plurality of pulses to feature detection neurons for detecting a specific graphical feature in receiving pulses from arbitrary processing channels remains constant. In any case, the conversion is performed so that pulse phases depend only on feature categories, as shown by the following expression:τ = C1ηk+ C2(17)wherein C1indicates a positive constant, and C2indicates a non-negative constant. In the case of representing information based on pulse width modulation, similar processing may be used to handle increasing or decreasing pulse widths or the offset amount. In the learning mode, as explained above in the first embodiment, an arrangement may be such that, even when an object to be recognized or detected is sized, the conversion to a plurality of scale levels is internally performed To perform learning control. In this embodiment, when a learning pattern having a fixed scale or size is presented for a channel, a pulse train pattern based on that particular channel in accordance with expression (15) or (16) by the in18shown channel activation level control circuit in another channel, ie another position of a time base converted. The converted pulse train is copied and transmitted to the subsequent layers (cf.23D). The Transformation into the scale invariant feature representation can not be applied to the Gabor wavelet transform or the low-level feature levels, such as a directed component. Alternatively, the same configuration as that of the first embodiment for processing to features of medium order with a predetermined level in complexity be used. More specifically, the detection or Integration of features with the complexity of a predetermined level or below by physically independent or spatially arranged processing channels carried out be, and can Features with a complexity of a predetermined level or above by obtaining the scale invariants representation as processed in this embodiment become. In this case, as far as middle order features having the complexity of a predetermined level or below, the population coding such as the coupling of processing channels is executed without complicated timing control, and the difference of processing channels in the form of the fire characteristic is output from physically different neurons. This arrangement provides an advantage in that the detection processing for up to medium-order features can be performed quickly and simultaneously at a plurality of scales as compared with one  Case where the processing of individual scale levels is implemented in series. For features high order can be a smaller scale of the circuit and a reduced power consumption of a circuit can be achieved as mentioned above has been. Thus, the feature level or level of complexity, in which the scale-invariant representation is obtained by taking into account all factors together, including the processing time, the complexity the timing control, the required circuit scale and of power consumption, to be decided. <Sixth Embodiment> In accordance with this embodiment becomes in the feature acquisition neurons, which to different Scale levels or processing channels are one such learning rule Creates that the arrival time intervals or the arrival time patterns the graphic features of the same category (for example L-shaped patterns) associated pulses in accordance differ with scale levels. The population coding is by linear coupling based on weighted addition of total time-shared Pulse signals performed. 22show a network configuration used for the sixth embodiment. The sixth embodiment shown in the drawing includes a pulse phase converter2101and a time base population encoder2201in the in the15and16shown configuration between population coding neurons and a feature detection layer, which is the subsequent layer is provided. With this arrangement, a feature detection layer (1, 1) receives signals obtained by using or arranging the pulses belonging to different processing channels on a time base of a predetermined channel. 20Fig. 12 illustrates an example of signals supplied to a feature integration layer when patterns of different sizes have been detected at the same location in the process of developing processing channels or scale levels in the time domain. As illustrated, the differences in the processing channels or scale levels are time shared to be determined at different positions on the time base of pulses reaching feature detection neurons. In other words, different phase offset amounts are given. Especially are in20The sub time windows w1,1, w2,1, w3,1 arethe time slots for the L-shaped pattern set acquired at the scale level 1, and w1, n, w2, n, w3, n arethe signal signal time slots which represent detected L-shaped patterns constituting a set of the same feature category and associated with a scale level. As in the case of the fifth embodiment, multi-scale processing can be implemented by a single circuit in the layers from the feature detection layer (1, 1) and thereafter, without the need to provide a different circuit for each processing channel, thereby enabling to obtain an economical circuit configuration. In other words, as in224, the physical discrimination between different processing channels is eliminated from the circuit configuration from the layer (1, 1) and thereafter. In this embodiment, the coupling and the population coding corresponding to the expressions (9) and (10), respectively, in the time domain on the signals of the scale levels or the processing channels arranged at temporally different positions in the layer (1, 1) and after carried out. The Outputs from the feature detection layer (1, 1) to a feature integration layer (2, 1) are in a time division mode for each processing channel or each scale level delivered. This applies to all subsequent layers. More specifically when a temporal integration on input signals of Feature detection cells performed will, impulses for a processing channel corresponding to the entire area of a subscale window forming a scale level. The Population coding in the feature integration layer is accomplished by Integrate input pulses in the multiple channels involved Time windows implemented. The graphic feature signals of different scale levels or processing channels are processed by population coding neurons in the following two steps. First, input pulses are integrated in the time window for each processing channel, thereby performing detection on the same feature category for each scale level, and then the calculation for the population  tion coding in accordance with expressions (9) and (10) by designating the integration value of each time window with pij. The thus time shared processing channel outputs are time integrated to allow the detection or recognition of a random pattern graphic pattern. This in24The example shown illustrates the transition of a signal train in an order from above, starting from the outputs of feature detection cells on each channel or scale level to the outputs of the population coding cells of a feature integration layer. In this example, the scale level ranges from 1 to n, and the feature category ranges from 1 to 3. 24Arepresents the outputs from the feature detection cells to the feature integration layer used on a time basis for each scale level and feature. There are a plurality of outputs for each feature simply because there are a plurality of feature cells for detecting the same feature or scale level, and the outputs reflect the presence of fluctuations due to Poisson noise or the like or due to the fluctuation in sensitivity the feature category or scale levels. The missing pulses associated with a feature 2 at a scale level n merely mean that no pulses have been detected. At scale level n, the phases on features 1 and 3 are also delayed compared to another scale. This means that the detection level is low. 24BFigure 12 shows the weighting functions for time integrating the outputs of the feature detection cells through the sub-sample cells of the feature integration layer.24Cshows the resulting outputs of the sub-scan cells.24DFigure 12 shows the time window weighting functions for individual scales used to integrate the outputs of the subsampling cells in population coding cells.24Eshows the distribution of the outputs from the population coding cells on a time basis. Now, descriptions are given of an example indicating an advantage obtained by the population coding. With respect to feature 1 at scale levels 1 and 2, the timebase pulses before and after population coding are modulated such that the scale 1 pulses have a phase delay,i.e., a time delayΔp11, while the scale 2 pulses have a phase advance, is called a time lead Δp12, have. This indicates that the outputs of the sub-scan cells at the activity level or the like of all channels have been modulated in accordance with expressions (3) and (4), and that the size or scale level of the object to be detected or detected is between the preset scale levels 1 and 2 lies. The processing thereafter may be performed on a time basis by the channel activation control or the gating function shown in FIGS18and16in the first embodiment. Around to put it more precisely, calculates the channel activation control circuit or the gate selects or selects a target channel activation level Channel from the temporally shared channel data. Then lay down the channel enable control circuit or the gate circuit neuron thresholds for the following Layers based on the channel activation level for each Time window for detects any channel or scale level, or controls signal levels by amplifying or steaming them through, or only allows signals from only one selected channel to pass through. In accordance With the embodiment set forth above will become features at a variety of resolutions or scale levels, and populate the population encoding the features of the detected multiple scale levels, whereby it possible is made, a deterioration in the detection performance too then to prevent when the size of an object to be detected changes arbitrarily. The Detection of feature elements of low or high order or of a graphic pattern element is transformed by the conversion into pulse trains with phases carried out, which are in agreement with resolutions or scale levels differ to the recognition processing at several scales through the single processing circuit too achieve. This configuration avoids the need for deployment physically different processing channels, which compared with a case where no such phase transformation is performed dramatically reduced circuit size and dramatically reduced Power consumption allowed. In addition, the pulse signals serving as feature detection signals are subjected to threshold processing of a weighted sum in a time window. This makes it possible to reliably detect a desired pattern even when an object to be detected or recognized arises  deformed due to positional change, rotation, etc., or a defectiveness or the like in detecting a feature due to a size change, or the influences of lighting, noise, or the like under complicated, diverse conditions. This advantage can be obtained without the need to rely on any particular network structure. In accordance with the embodiment described above, the positions the pulse trains in time windows that are timed on a single input line of a predetermined neuron, predetermined pattern features and scale levels assigned. With this arrangement, the Difficulties with the wiring between neuron elements bypassed which is a significantly reduced size and one significantly reduced power consumption of a detection circuit or detecting a predetermined object by a two-dimensional Pattern processing allowed while the aforementioned high reliability is maintained. Further features are detected at a variety of resolutions or scale levels, and is multiplexing or population coding on the features the detected multiple scale levels, thereby making it possible to even to prevent a deterioration in the detection performance if you like the size of a changes arbitrarily to the object to be detected. The Detection of feature elements is achieved by transforming into pulse trains with phases carried out, have the phases that are in agreement with resolutions or scale levels to the detection processing at multiple scales through a single processing circuit achieve. This configuration dramatically reduces the circuit size and the Power consumption. <Seventh Embodiment> In this embodiment Descriptions are given of a case in which a pattern is detected or is recognized while a selective attention is paid. 27shows the general configuration of a pattern detection or pattern recognition apparatus according to the seventh embodiment. In this embodiment will the detailed explanation the application omitted speech recognition. In short, that is selective attention for Speech recognition in the following description equivalent to, for example, Extracting and processing only in a specific band or phoneme, selective Process only features extracted by a procedure such as an independent one Component analysis, or extracting and processing the language or the characteristic of a particular speaker, that of context depends. The following will describe the process of entering an image. A was path includes feature detection layers102((1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (1, N), feature integration layers103((2, 0), (2, 1), ..., (2, N), and an attention region or fixation region designation control layer108, The fixation region setting control layer108receives a feature extraction map from a feature integration layer (2, 0), which will be discussed below, and a feedback link from an upper layer, such as a feature position detection layer (3, k), via a Wo path, which will be discussed below. Based on the feedback signals, the fixation region fixation control layer results108control of setting the position and size of a fixation region and updating or the like thereof. The details of the operating mechanism of the fixation region fixing control layer108will be explained later. Feature detection layers (1, k) as a whole form processing channels of a variety of resolutions or scale levels. Specifically, taking an example in which the Gabor wavelet transform is performed by a feature detection layer (1, 0), a set of feature detection cells having Gabor filter cores in their respective receive field structures share the same scale level but have different directional selectivities. to the same processing channel in the feature detection layer (1, 0) as in FIG12is shown. In the subsequent layer (1, 1), the feature detection cells for detecting higher order features that receive the outputs from the feature detection cells belong to the same processing channel. In further subsequent layers (1, k), where k> 1, also the feature detection cells which connect the outputs of a plurality of feature integration cells forming the same channel in a layer (2, k-1) belong to this channel. In every verar  Processing channel is implemented processing at the same scale or resolution to detect and detect low-order features to high-order features via hierarchical parallel processing. The Feature integration layer (2, 0) on the What path has a predetermined Receive field structure and consists of neuron elements that generate pulse trains. Below, the receive field becomes the area of the connection the output elements an immediately preceding layer, and the receive field structure becomes the distribution of the connection weights mean. Integrate the neuron feature integration layers (2, 0) a plurality of neuron element outputs in the receive fields of the feature detection layer (1, 0). The integration is through Subsampling by local averaging or the like, and by calculation, such as coupling the results processing at different scale levels. each Sharing the reception field of the neurons in the feature integration layer share the same structure as long as the neurons become the same Belong to layer. Feature detection layers (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, N), and feature integration layers (2, 1), (2, 2), ..., (2, N) have predetermined reception field structures, be won individually through learning. As in the case of the aforementioned Layers capture the earlier ones Layers ((1, 1), ...) a variety of different features in individual feature acquisition modules, and integrate the later layers ((2, 1), ...) detection results regarding a variety of characteristics, received from a previous feature detection layer. The earlier Feature detection layers are connected or wired to around the outputs of the cell elements of the feature integration layers in the preceding stage, to the same channel belong. The feature integration layers implement two types of processing. One type of processing is subsampling by, for example Averaging over the expenses of local regions, d. H. the local reception field of the neuron on the feature integration layer, the populations of Feature detection cells of the same feature category and the same Scale levels. The other type of processing is the Results of processing at different scale levels to integrate. In integration processing, the outputs become a plurality of feature detection cell populations thereof Feature category linear coupled or nonlinear coupled. A Wo path having feature position detection layers ((3, 0), ..., (3, k) receives the outputs of predetermined (not necessarily all) feature detection layers on the what path, and is in the outputs of the positions of Low-order, middle-order and high-order features are involved The Wo path forms the connection of the feedback from an upper feature integration layer or a feature detection layer, as in FIG1((1, N) → (3, k) → fixation region fixing control layer108) is shown. In other words, it is assumed that the feedback connection previously by learning as a connection to an attention control neuron2901(29) of a fixation region fixation control layer108which is associated with a particular low-order feature forming a high-order feature pattern detected by an upper layer. The learning involves the process of self-organization in which, for example, the connection is potentiated or formed by simultaneously firing an upper-layer feature detection neuron and a lower-layer feature detection neuron within a predetermined time width, otherwise the connection is suppressed or erased , The outputs of each feature location acquisition layer107preserve relatively high resolution components of the outputs of an associated feature detection layer102the same. This is simplified by the arrows from the feature detection layers to the feature position detection layers in FIG27shown. Alternatively, the outputs of the feature integration layers are temporarily preserved to create a map showing the salience level of each feature category. A challenge ticket in a particular layer shows the spatial distributions of the detection levels or probabilities of existence on input data of a plurality of feature categories or feature elements of similar complexity. The processing implemented in the feature position detection layers on the Wo path will be discussed again later. In another network configuration, the in28and having a What path identical to that in FIG1With the exception of the receive field size, a number of feature integration layers preserve the spatial relationship between feature categories all the way through  to high-order features. Therefore, the sizes of the reception fields are also set to a predetermined level or less in upper layers. For this reason, the feedback connection is made from a feature integration layer to the fixation region fixing control layer108without providing a feature position detection layer. Selective attention Now, the configuration and operation of the fixation region setting control layer becomes108explained. In an initial state, the size of the fixation region set in the same layer is defined as an entire screen with respect to a maximum size processing channel among the aforementioned plurality of preset scale levels. To be precise, as in29shown, attention control neurons2901assigned to a predetermined number of positions where the feature detection is performed, arranged by input data in the fixation region control layer. In the29The circled regions shown simply show the fixation points (in layer (1, 0)) and the associated regions in each subsequent layer. For the convenience of explanation, only one such associated region is shown in each layer; however, there may exist a plurality of associated regions in each layer since the detection is generally performed on a variety of feature categories. The sizes of the regions are approximately the same as the sizes of receiving fields. Referring to29The bold arrows directed from the feature detection layers to the feature position detection layers simplify that the neurons of the feature position detection layers receive the outputs of the associated neurons of the feature detection layers. The neurons of the feature position detection layers usually have reception fields smaller than those of the neurons of the feature integration layer and sub-scan as in the case of the feature integration layers. Consequently, the information about the spatial arrangement regarding feature categories may be considered to be better than that obtained in the feature integration. The individual attention control neurons2901Receive inputs via the intermediary of feedback connections from an upper feature position detection layer (3, 2) or (3, 1) via the Wo path. In the in28the individual attention control neurons receive2901Inputs via the mediator of feedback connections of neurons at the positions associated with the attention control neurons in a feature integration layer (2, 2). The attention control neurons may receive the outputs from a feature integration layer (2, 0) in parallel. A predetermined weighted addition or non-linear addition of these two or three types of inputs is performed, or selection control on a fixation region based on these inputs is performed (this will be discussed below). A particular attention control neuron selected as the result of the aforementioned addition or selection control is activated, thereby determining the fixation region.  The above-mentioned feedback amount refers to the output level or a size thereof proportional to a neuron of an upper feature position detection layer or a memory  malintegrationsschicht on a certain processing channel and a certain feature category. In the present invention, case (1) or (3) applies. The method described in (2) is well known and has a disadvantage as described above. Thus, the fixation position is determined by a contribution of the amount of feedback from an upper layer. The process of recognizing an object is not begun until the determination of a fixation region or the activation of an attention control neuron is performed. The determination is achieved by the coordination between a top layer neuron and a low-layer neuron in a bottom-up process based on the processing of signals from a bottom layer to an top layer, and a bottom-to-top process from an upper layer to a top layer lower layer is performed. Therefore, in an initial step in which a top layer neuron outputs a signal in a first bottom-up process, a recognition state or a detection state is not set. At this stage, they are still in a latent state in which a high-order-end feature map has been output in an upper layer. Based on an attention control signal generated as the result of the top-to-bottom process, high-end feature detection and integration neurons provide output to another top-to-bottom process in an upper layer. At this stage, an established state is determined in which neurons of high output level are located and sparsely present in the upper layer. This completes a series of detection and detection operations. The upper layer is not necessarily on an in1or28shown layer (2, N), or on a in1shown layer (3, k) limited. The upper layer may instead be an intermediate layer lower than the highest-level layer, or an upper layer (not shown) higher than the highest-level layer. The number of attention control neurons2901does not match the number of neurons, that is, a number NFOof the positions at which features are detected in a feature integration layer (2, 0). Alternatively, the number of attention control neurons2901be identical to, for example, a number (NFp) of neurons of the top feature position detection layer. If NFp<NFO, then the number of sample points for performing attention control will be less than the number of low order feature detection positions. However, as long as NFp<< νNFO, in practical use, there will hardly be a problem if the lower limit of the size of an object to be detected is νS0, where 0 <ν <1 and So denotes the entire area of the image. The low-order feature map received by an attention control neuron may be an output from a feature detection layer (e.g., layer (1, 0)). A fixation region determined by updating a fixation position has a predetermined size determined by a processing channel at which the neurons of the topmost layer that have a maximum feedback amount to the attention control neuron2901or the channel to which a feature integration neuron associated with an attention control neuron belongs. This applies to the case of (3) described above. Alternatively, the default size is determined by a processing channel to which a feature integration layer neuron belongs, the feature integration layer being assigned to an attention control neuron that receives a maximum or maximum linear sum of an input from an upper layer and a low-order feature issue. In this embodiment, the size of the fixation region is defined as the core size of a Gabor filter belonging to the processing channel of the aforementioned feature integration layer (2, 0). One possible particular configuration for the fixation region setting control layer may be the gate circuit1902from19and a fixation position update control circuit3001from30, which will be shown below, in the in15or16shown channel processing structure in addition to the attention control neuron2901include. The Gate switching is used to mask low-order features used to view the data of only a specific section of a region to forward to an upper layer. The gate circuit works to selectively extract a region to pay attention to is, in a selected one specific channel, from the outputs from the feature integration layer (2, 0), then forwarding the signals to the extracted region is assigned to a subsequent channel. Thus, a fixation region by propagating only low order feature signals from one specific region on a given channel and input data. In another possible one Configuration, a particular attention control neuron is selected and activated in response to, for example, a feedback signal from one upper layer to thereby provide a pulse to stimulate firing over a Synapse to the neuron at the assigned position in the feature integration layer (2, 0). This causes the associated neuron of the feature integration layer, to be turned on or ready to fire. The fire ready State in this case refers to a state in which the Neuron is ready, an issue from a pacemaker neuron or to receive such, that is, a transition state or a State in which such a transitional state is allowed. The31and32show the examples of the paths of signal propagation between the fixation region fixation control layer108, a feature integration layer (2, 0), and a feature detection layer (1, 1). The in both the31as well as the32shown configurations use a gate3101which is provided together with a common bus of a digital circuit and has a switching function, and a switching signal control circuit3102for controlling the on / off state of the switching function at high speed. Referring to31sets the fixation control neuron2901a connection to a neuron in a region of a predetermined size, which is unique to the processing channel of a neuron, to a region centering around a plurality of feature integration layer neurons109that is, the neurons on the feature integration layer associated with fixation positions (hereinafter referred to as ""attention center neurons."") The size of the region109is intrinsic to the processing channel to which the attention center neurons belong on an integration layer. In the31The configuration shown has connections between the attention control neuron2901and a feature integration layer, and fixation positions are controlled solely on the basis of the feedback amounts of a feature detection layer on the Wo path. A modified configuration may be used in which attention control neurons and feature integration layer neurons are reciprocally connected such that the fixation positions are controlled based on the preceding feedback extents and feature integration layer outputs. In accordance with the in32The configuration shown has the attention control neuron2901a similar connection to a gating or goal layer3201equivalent to the gating circuit1902from19such that the outputs of the feature integration layer (2, 0) pass over the median of the goal layer3201the feature detection layer (1, 1) are supplied. In the in31In the configuration shown, a predominantly circular or rectangular region having a size intrinsic to the processing channel centered around the feature integration layer neuron located at a fixation position is activated, and the output of the feature integration layer (2, 0) assigned to the region is forwarded to the feature detection layer (1, 1). In the in32In the configuration shown, only the gate of a region having a size unique to the processing channel centered around the fixing position is opened, and the output of the feature integration layer (2, 0) associated with the region becomes the feature detecting layer (1, 1 ). The Gate layer is formed by an FPGA or the like, and equivalent to a typical gate circuit in which all logical circuits that correspond to the individual positions of attention control neurons exist between the feature integration layer (2, 0) and the feature detection layer (1, 1). When an attention control neuron is activated, only a logical circuit unit that is connected to a corresponding Position in the gate layer or gate layer is activated, to transmit a signal to a subsequent layer. The size of a fixation region to be determined depends on the processing channel to which the feature integration layer neuron associated with the aforementioned attention control neuron belongs, as previously explained. For example, if the associated feature integration layer neuron matches that in FIG15or161, the size of the fixation region will be the maximum one below preset sizes. Now, the mechanism for updating control of fixing positions will be described. In the case of (3) the above-mentioned attention control mechanism, once fixed, the fixation position is basically updated in the order of magnitude of feedback amounts generated by the attention control neurons from an upper layer in a region near a predetermined range of a most recent one Fixation position updated. The size of feedback dimensions here refers to the size next to a maximum value. In the case of the pre  1), the positions are updated in the order of an evaluation value Gf, as shown below:Gf= η1Sf+ η2SPB, f(18)where Gfdenotes an evaluation value with respect to a feature f, Sfdenotes the protrusion with respect to a feature f received from a lower feature integration layer, SFB, fdenotes a feedback amount, which is the attention control neuron2901concerning the feature f which is detected at the uppermost layer or an intermediate layer feature detecting layer, and η1and η2denote positive constants. The constants η1and η2may be adaptively changed in accordance with the nature of an object to be detected or detected, for example by a detailed comparison of features for identifying a particular object among other similar objects, or a middle (coarse) comparison of features in capturing features associated with a particular category, such as a person's face. To be more specific, the ratio of η2to η1 is setto a small value for the aforementioned detailed comparison, whereas the ratio for the aforementioned middle (or coarse) comparison is set to a large value. Such control of the constants η1and η2is performed by changing the associated synaptic connections to attention control neurons. 33shows an example of the configuration, which is an attention control neuron2901and a circuit3302for controlling the assignment of inputs to the attention control neuron when the control of the constants η1and η2 associatedwith the attention of the attention control neuron is performed. In this case, the input distribution control circuit connects3302to the synapse3301which is involved in the modulation of the detection level of the challenge map signal inputs of low-order features received from lower layers, and also to another synpse3301, which is involved in the modulation of the detection level of feedback signals from upper layers. The input distribution control circuit3302mainly controls the phase delay amounts at the synapses corresponding to the values of η1and η2in response to external control signals (for example, a signal relating to a subject coming from another, in1not shown, the signal indicating whether a particular mode is the one for detecting an object or for a detailed identification). The Size one adjacent region is about the same as the size of a fixation region in Input data (for example, a value that does not exceed 10 times the fixation region size). The search is limited to the neighboring region to a high processing speed to maintain. As long as the processing speed on a reasonable Level can be maintained, the search area can entire Cover image data. Now, the descriptions of the fixation position update control circuit will be described3001for controlling the sequential update of fixation positions. This circuit, which in30is shown mainly by a primary memory3002a feedback amount that the attention control neuron2901which is at a point corresponding to a most recent position, an input device of feedback amounts in an adjacent region3003, and an updated position investigator3004determining a next candidate feedback amount that follows a feedback amount at a most recent fixation position in the adjacent region, and constructs an attention control neuron that receives, detects, and activates the next candidate feedback. The updated position investigator3004includes a comparator3007containing the input from the primary memory3002and the input means of feedback amounts in an adjacent region3003and comparing the feedback amount at a most recent attention control neuron with the feedback amount in its adjacent region receives a second feedback signal amplifier3006, which will be discussed below, and a next candidate feedback amount detector3005, If the updated position investigator3004about the next candidate feedback extent detector3005Finds a feedback amount that matches the most recent feedback extent, then causes the investigator3004the second feedback signal amplifier3006to issue a pulse to the attendant control neuron associated therewith. The aforementioned ""coincidentally with the most recent feedback rate ""specifically means that The following. When a feedback amount happens to be in an adjacent region is input and the two feedback amounts in accordance with the above-mentioned Procedure compared, then when the difference in-between within a predetermined reference or threshold range or if the feedback rate of a is larger compared to the object to be compared as the most recent feedback amount, which can happen when updating a search area, this situation as ""coincidental with the most recent feedback rate "" this will be the next one updated item effectively recorded. Well on the simplified in the31and32Referring to the configuration shown, the transmission of signals between the attention control neuron becomes2901and the fixation position update control circuit3001to be discribed. We will discuss it later, are a certain attention control neuron2901and the fixation position update control circuit3001are temporarily connected to each other, and the attention control neuron associated with the updated position selected in accordance with the aforementioned method is received by receiving a secondary feedback input from the updated position determiner3004activated. The secondary feedback input is a feedback signal having a signal level proportional to the amount of feedback fed from an upper layer to an attention control neuron. This opens a fixation region that is intrinsic to the neuron, and only the signal corresponding to the data of that region in input data will be transmitted to a subsequent layer. The aforementioned temporary, mutual connection will be described in more detail. An attention-oriented neuron activated at a certain time, that is, the attention-control neuron to be put under the control for transmitting a signal to a succeeding layer is temporarily connected to another particular attention-control neuron in an adjacent region existing in correspondence with the above attention-control neuron , This temporary, two-way connection is made to route the signal through the intermediary of a local common bus. More specifically, among other attention control neurons in an adjacent region, only one neuron that is in a random position spontaneously fires and outputs a peak pulse within a predetermined time range (for example, in the range of tens of milliseconds), and the peak pulse arrives activated attention control neuron over the common bus. As a result, a channel becomes in communication with the already-enabled fixation position update control circuit3001activated only during the aforementioned period. Accordingly, the shared bus is accessed only when, for example, another neuron is fired as a most recent attention control neuron in an adjacent area. More specifically, a variable resistance array whose wiring resistance temporarily drops when a pulse signal is propagated from the fired neuron on the line connected to the common bus, and a control circuit (not shown) is used for this purpose. As another alternative are a gate3101or a switching circuit and a switching signal control circuit3102, simplified shown in the31and32, provided between the attention control neurons and the common bus. The switching signal control circuit3102sends a turn-on signal to one of gate circuits (""c"" of3103, shown in the31and32) using a fire pulse signal from an attention control neuron as a trigger, thereby temporarily opening a channel, ie, switching the connection to the common bus ON. After a next candidate fixation position is selected, the secondary feedback signal amplifier amplifies1906by means of advancing a pulse phase in the case of a phase modulation, a feedback signal from an upper layer to an attention control neuron to a predetermined level, after which the amplified feedback signal is fed back to the attention control neuron. In this case, the number of attention control neurons activated at a certain time, which thus means a fixation region, is limited to one per feature category. For this reason, when the attention control neuron activated at a certain time shifts to another attention control neuron in the activation state, the activity of the originally activated neuron is suppressed for a predetermined time. This is implemented by forming an inhibiting mutual connection between nearest attention control neurons. The inhibitory connection is through the dotted line extending from the attention control neuron2901of the31and32extends, shown. Of the Range of the feedback amount with Related to the attention control described above a preset lower limit. After the control to a fixation position corresponding to the lower limit goes, the controller is at an initial fixation point position reset. Of the The aforementioned mechanism for directly controlling the update a fixation region through the attention control layer and by using the feedback signals from upper layers represents the following, using state of the art not available Benefits ready. in the Comparison with a case where only one score card for features low order is used to fixation region control perform, allows it's the mechanism mentioned, an efficient, fast search to achieve, and make it about it out possible, to avoid a meaningless visual search in which one Fixation region continues with to sway between two feature patterns back and forth. In An object to be viewed can only be looked for in particular Feature part or pattern (for example, the eyes or the like in the object that is a face) selectively and efficiently searched become. In this case, instead of the feedback from the top Layer the feedback from an intermediate layer with respect to the detection of a feature part to be used in an object. The Looking for the next one updated position in a neighboring region of the newest Fixation position allows a quick fixation position update control to achieve. Even if there are a lot of objects belonging to the same category belong, can by properly setting the sizes of adjacent regions, in which the search is performed is executed, the control to get a stable, sequential search of an object to be executed by another without causing the shift range of fixation point positions is fixed on any particular object. Processing in the feature position detection layer Referring to29Feature position detection layers have Wo paths separated from a Was path and connect to a feature detection layer (1, k) at the same hierarchical level, and further, a feedback connection to a fixation region setting control layer108ago. The feature position detection layer107partly the same arrangement and function as those of the subsampling neuron1501the feature integration layer103with the exception of that through the feature integration layer103and that the receive field sizes do not change significantly between upper layers and lower layers to prevent information regarding a feature ordering relationship from being lost. Therefore, in the feature position detection layer107the neurons are arranged on the basis of feature categories, and connect the neurons to feature detection layer neurons to perform the subsampling. Thus, the distribution of firing neurons representing a coarse spatial distribution or arrangement regarding a to-be-detected or detected object can be obtained in the feature position detection layer of an uppermost feature position detection layer. Pulse signal processing in the feature position detection layer The pulse signal processing of the feature position detection layer is identical to that of the sub-sampling neuron1501the feature integration layer103, The neurons of a layer (3, k) sub-scan on the basis of an average output level from the feature detection cells of a layer (1, k) in the preceding stage without being put under the control of any pacing neurons. The average output level in this case is obtained from outputs received within a time window with an independent phase for each sub-sampling neuron. Processing procedure for fixation position setting control 37outlines the processing for controlling the determination of a fixation position. First, in step S3701, the fixation position is set to the center of an image to be the entire image as the size  to define a fixation region. Then, in step S3702, the processing by means of the what path up to the uppermost layer is implemented. At this stage, as mentioned above, the state in which an object has been sensed, that is, a recognized state, has not yet been reached. After that is determined in step S3703 on the basis of a feedback amount or the like, received from a feature position detection layer (3, M) corresponding to the uppermost layer via the Wo path or the like, a neuron in the feature integration layer that is the attention control neuron corresponds to a maximum feedback amount or a predetermined evaluation value given by the expression (17), receives is specified as a new fixation position, and the size of the fixation region, the for the processing channel to which this particular feature integration layer neuron belongs, established. In step S3704, the recognition processing in FIG executed the what-path. In the next Step S3705, it is determined whether the fixation position is updated and if the result of the investigation is confirmed, becomes a search for a new candidate attention control neuron in a region nearby the latest fixation position performed in step S3706, thereby the control for updating the fixation region is performed. If A fixation region should be updated as follows determined. In a first example it is determined if it is another Attention control neuron with a sufficient level of Feedback amount in one neighboring region. Such a neuron is called a ""next candidate neuron"". In one The second example determines if there is no next candidate neuron in an adjacent region exists, and whether it is an undefined Fixation position in a screen there. In this case is a circuit (not shown) for detecting the presence an undefined fixation position required. In one third example, it is determined whether an external control signal received has been. In In the above first example, a next candidate neuron is matched selected by the method described above to the next Fixation position or the like. In the above second example will be the next Fixation position to any unspecified position outside the newest adjacent region or any unspecified position, which adjoins the neighboring region. The above third example applies to a case in which, when an actuation signal is issued by For example, a user who operates a shutter switch is not when a control signal is detected, the user then instructs to urge on an update, and will be the signal for the update instruction detected as a control signal. In step S3707, as the result of the update, the attention control neuron receiving a semi-maximal feedback amount mentioned above is activated, and a signal for setting the next fixation region from the activated neuron to a feature integration layer in the in31shown case or to a goal layer in the in32shown case. In step S3708, a part of a certain processing channel is opened to thereby forward the signal from the feature integration layer neuron associated with the updated fixation region to a feature detection layer (1, 1). On the other hand, if, as a result of determining whether the attention should be updated, it is determined not to perform the update (see the above-described three cases of determinations), then the control operation for updating the fixation region is ended. Examples of modifications As an alternative, the recognition of a graphic pattern or the like is performed using a network that is modulated by synapse elements that modulate pulse widths into analog values and integrate-and-fire neurons in the in27shown network configuration is formed. In this case, the modulation by synapse is expressed by Wa= SijWbwhen the pulse width of a presynaptic signal is referred to as Wb, and the pulse width of a postsynaptic signal is denoted as Wa, where Sij is thesame as the connection strength in Expression (5) of the first embodiment. In order to achieve a wide dynamic range for the modulation, the basic pulse width of a pulse signal must be set to a value sufficiently smaller than the cycle, d, h. a basic pulse interval. A neuron fires or pulses when its potential is due to charges due to the inrush of a plurality of pulse streams representing predetermined feature elements  have exceeded a predetermined threshold. In the case of pulse width modulation or the like, the weighted addition of received pulses is not particularly necessary for each sub-time window; however, integration is implemented in a time window having a predetermined width. In this case, the feature element or graphic patterns to be detected depend solely on the cumulative total of signals for the feature detection layer neuron, ie, the total sum of pulse current values. The width of input pulses corresponds to the value of a weighting function. When another alternative may be first the configuration for obtaining a scale-invariant feature representation be used to thereby eliminate the need for a variety of processing channels for medium and high orders to work around. In accordance with the below The configuration to be described may be the scale invariant recognition performance be maintained, so that the efficiency of selective attention processing can be improved. this leads to to a simplified circuit configuration, a smaller one Size, and reduced power consumption. In the basic configuration discussed above was the controller for setting a fixation region after the Population coding for Low-order features performed, and became population coding for every Layer plane performed. Alternatively you can the feature representations at different population coding scale levels and the aforementioned population coding only for features low order be, and can scale-invariant feature representations, d. H. a scale invariant impulse information transformation, by a phase modulation of characteristics associated with pulses are performed how later will be described. After that, the controller can set the aforementioned fixation region, and can the detection of middle and high order features in a scale invariant Feature representation field accomplished become. The control for setting the fixation region could be before the population coding executed become; however, the processing efficiency will be lower than in the case where it is done after population coding. Around the conversion to the previous scale invariant pulse information to achieve the characteristics which become the same feature category belong, but have different scale levels or sizes, by an identical one Pulse interval represents. The conversion is performed, for example, such that a phase offset amount in one Arrival pattern of a plurality of pulses at feature detection neurons for detecting a particular graphical feature in the receive of pulses from any processing channels remains constant. the same Processing can be implemented to enlarge or reduce one Pulse width or offset width when information by pulse width modulation represents becomes. Further can be used in feature acquisition neurons that are at different scale levels or processing channels belong, a learning rule can be set up so that the arrival time intervals or the arrival time pattern of the pulses, the graphic features are assigned to the same category (for example L-shaped patterns), for different Scale levels are different and shared in terms of time become. The Population coding is by linear coupling or the like based on the weighted addition of all in terms of time shared pulse signals performed. In a selective attention processing become the output data from a feature integration layer (2, 0), which are assigned to a specific subregion, before the Population coding selectively extracted as a fixation region. The population coding on the selected output data becomes running a timebase. In layers starting from a feature detection layer (1, 1) and thereafter, multi-scale processing by a single Circuit can be implemented, eliminating the need to deploy different circuits for different processing channels is bypassed. The result is an economical circuit configuration. In In other words, it is in the layers starting from the layer (1, 1) and afterwards possible a physical distinction between different processing channels in one Circuit configuration to avoid. The Outputs from the feature detection layer (1, 1) to a feature integration layer (2, 1) are in a time division mode for each processing channel or each scale level delivered. Example of an application an imaging device 38outlines the processing of a photographic process while selective attention is being paid in an imaging device. First, in step S3801, to identify in advance an object to be detected or detected, model data on an object to be photographed, such as the face of a target person when photographing a person, is extracted from a memory1106or loaded from outside via the mediator of a communication unit (not shown) integrated with the imaging device into a temporal memory (not shown). Then, in step S3802, initialization for attention control processing in a photographing standby state, such as a state in which a shutter is pressed halfway, is performed. The initialization here is, for example, setting a fixation region to the center of the image or to the entire image size. following For example, in step S3808, the fixation region update is performed described above to determine a fixation region, which satisfies a predetermined requirement (e.g. the basis of a top-level output determines that an object to be photographed has been detected). In step S3804 the update of the fixation region is interrupted, and becomes the certification for optimal shooting conditions (such as AF, AE, AW, and zoom) carried out, centering around a fixation region selected in step S3805. To this Time will be the position of the object to be photographed in step S3806 on a viewfinder display by means of a marker, such as a crosshair, displayed to allow the user to to confirm the object to be photographed. When next is checked in step S3807 on detection error, for example, determines if a shutter switch was depressed within a predetermined time range, or whether a user has an instruction to search for another object has issued (for example, the state in which a half-depressed shutter was released). If it is determined that a detection error is done, then the program returns to step S3803 to execute the To restart the fixation region update. If determined if there is no detection error, then the photographing will take place implemented under the specified photography conditions. The Use the pattern capture or pattern recognition device in accordance with the embodiment described above in the imaging Device allows it, a subject even then reliable and effectively capture or recognize when the position of a subject or the size of the same in a screen is unknown when a variety of subjects exist in an input image. This feature can be high Speed in a real-time mode with less used Performance during execution the detection of a person or the like and the control of conditions (AF, AE, etc.) to ensure optimal photographing conditions are implemented. <Eighth Embodiment> In this embodiment, the ranking or priority levels for the locations (the positions in the picture) or the like to which attention is to be paid selectively are determined in advance to quickly achieve the update of the selective attention itself. An advantage of the eighth embodiment is that the processing efficiency, that is, the speed of update of the fixation point, by setting the ranking in advance before starting a detection or the like by means of a fuser3401for setting the priority levels, which will be defined below, is considerably improved. In addition, the allowed range of the priority levels is provided for restricting the positions that can be updated so that the fixation positions on only the attention control neurons having the priority levels within the range can be updated. This allows a further faster processing. 34shows the configuration of an essential portion of the embodiment centering around a fixing region fixing control layer108, A priority determiner3401is provided for setting the ranking in selecting attention control neurons based on the low-order feature scorecard output from a feature integration layer (2, 0), and the feedback amount from an upper layer. The priority determinant3401and a fixation position update control circuit3001should be near the fixation region fixation control layer108or may be provided on the fixation region setting control layer108be provided. The priority determinant3401and the fixation position update control circuit3001consist  from digital signal processing circuits or logic gate arrays. As in the previous embodiments, the fixation region fixation control layer has108the attention control neurons are assigned to the positions where the detection of low-order features on input data is performed. The number of attention control neurons is obtained by multiplying the number of processing channels by the number of feature categories, and the attention control neurons are located at the positions indicated by the ellipses in34are indicated. The magnitude indicating a priority level corresponds to a linear sum of the output of a feature integration layer or the value of the salience level and a feedback amount or order thereof received from an upper layer as shown by expression (18). A control signal for activating the attention control neurons in the descending order of the priority levels is supplied from the fixation position update control circuit3001sent to a particular attention control neuron at the position to be updated. In order to determine the positions, that is, the addresses of the attention control neurons with higher priority levels, the fixation position update control circuit employs3001in accordance with a predetermined method (which will be discussed below) to the attention control neurons to calculate their priority levels. Then, the fixation position update control circuit sorts3001moreover, the information regarding the addresses of the neurons in the descending order of the priority levels and stores them in a primary memory (not shown). At this time, the fixation position update control circuit stores3001only the addresses of the attention control neurons with the priority levels within a preset allowed range of priority levels. Of the Access the attention control neurons for the purpose of computing their priority levels becomes for example spiral-shaped Sampling the same, starting with an initial one Fixation position, that is, the center of the image as in the previous embodiments. Alternatively, a processing channel to be searched is based on of photographing conditions, such as the distance to a subject and a magnifying power, and only the associated population of attention control neurons can be searched. If the size of a subject in advance is known, then the size of a Object in a screen based on photography conditions accordingly known so that the scale level is narrowed down. The fixation position update control circuit3001selects the attention control neurons that are in a preset range of priority levels instead of selecting all of the attention control neurons registered by accessing their addresses in sequence. For example, in an initial stage for performing a visual search, that is, selective attention control, the allowable range of priority levels is set to a higher level, and every time a permitted range of priority levels is passed, the number of times Cycles are counted as the number of update lookups for fixation positions so that the allowed range of priority levels can be updated. For example, the allowable range of priority levels may be made narrower or wider every time the number of cycles is added up. <Ninth Embodiment> The configuration of a ninth embodiment centering around a fixation region setting control layer108, is in the31and32shown. In the ninth embodiment, an attention control neuron receives2901a feedback connection from an upper layer (for example, a feature position detection layer (3, 2) or a feature integration layer (2, 2)) containing information regarding the position and probability of existence of an object belonging to the category of the object to be detected; and a further feedback connection from an intermediate layer (eg, a feature position detection layer (3, 1) or a feature integration layer (2, 1)) containing the information regarding the positions and the probabilities of existence of middle order features representing the object thereof certain category to be recognized has (see the description of population coding), or outputs the information regarding detection levels Using control signals or the like from the outside (for example, another upper layer than that in FIG27the topmost layer shown) gives the attention control neuron2901priorities to a feedback input from an upper layer during a search for the object in a detection mode while giving priority to a feedback input from an intermediate layer while the object is detected in a detection mode. In this case, searching for an object in the capture mode simply means capturing  an object belonging to the same category as an object to be recognized (for example, the detection of a face). The detection here means to determine whether the detected object is the object to be recognized (for example, whether the detected object is the face of a certain person) by executing the fixation position setting based on more detailed features. In the latter recognition mode, a ""gaze level"" is higher than in the former detection mode. The priorities based on the weighting of feedback links are determined by a feedback extent modulator3601set in36is shown. The flow of processing passing through the transmitter of the feedback modulator3601is implemented in35shown. In step S3501, the feedback extent modulator receives3601first the amount of feedback from an upper layer and the amount of feedback from an intermediate layer for the attention control neurons. A mode control signal indicating whether the mode is the detection mode or the detection mode is supplied in step S3502. If the mode is the acquisition mode, then the program takes only the feedback amount from an upper layer or a linear sum of the above two feedback amounts that have been appropriately weighted (αF1+ βF2, where F1denotes the feedback amount from an upper layer, and F2 isthe feedback amount of an intermediate layer). The program then calculates a link feedback amount that provides a larger contribution of the feedback amount from the upper layer such that α> β ≥ 0, and performs modulation or amplification to output the calculated feedback amount in step S3503. If the mode is the detection mode, then the program takes only the feedback amount from an intermediate layer or a linear sum of the above two feedback amounts, and calculates a connection feedback amount that provides a larger contribution of the feedback amount from the intermediate layer such that 0 ≦ α < β, and performs a similar modulation in step S3504.  When fixation positions are given fluctuations, the variation width can be adjusted in accordance with the degree of attention. The degree of attention is the degree of importance attached to the level of feedback from a layer in which a particular pattern that forms the entire pattern of an object to be recognized or detected, or in which the arrangement of particular patterns that form such constituent Elements is captured, is given. For example, the degree of attention with respect to the value of a detection level of the above feedback amount is expressed on an attention control neuron, the value being determined by using, as its reference, the detection level of a feedback input from an upper layer in which the entire pattern or a higher order feature is detected. The value is represented by a ratio of a feedback amount F2from an intermediate layer to a feedback amount F1from an upper layer (F2/ F1). The range of variation of a fixation position is controlled in such a manner as to reduce the range of variation for a higher degree of attention. The degree of attention may be a monotone increase function of the sum total of the feedback amounts from an upper layer, or may be determined by amplifying feedback amounts to increase the degree of attention with decreasing differences in the feedback amount between a plurality of attention control neurons. The degree of attention here corresponds to the amount of feedback fed to the neurons. The gain of the feedback amounts in the latter case mentioned above is assigned by associated attention control neurons2901in the fixation region setting control layer108through the in36shown feedback extent modulator3601carried out. One The method described below is for lending a temporal Variation for a fix point position available. For example, in similar to a neighboring region to the one in the first embodiment, which centers around the most recent fix point position, a updated fixing point position based on the above modeled feedback extent the same way as in the first embodiment established. Then the position is given a random variation, for the final updated attention control neuron or fixation position set. At this time, the width of the random variation in accordance are controlled with the degree of gaze, as described above. <Tenth Embodiment> In the tenth embodiment, as in39is a subject detection or subject recognition device1111installed in an image input device such as a camera or a video camera. The device1111includes a support information detector3902for acquiring information such as the position and size of an object from which a user intends to input or photograph an image, and a fixation region setting control means3901according to the embodiments described above. In this embodiment, the assistance information detector becomes3902using a visual axis as an example. The support information detector or the visual axis detector3902and the fixation region setting device3901work together to perform the control to set a fixture position. This arrangement makes it possible to achieve an automatic fast photographing process which is ideally suited to a particular object in the image and which makes it possible to reflect the intention of the user. The support information in addition to the visual axis may be explicitly set by a user. In the following description, the assistance information detector will be described3902the ""visual axis detector3902"" to be named. Referring to39is the imaging device1101primarily with an image-forming optical system1102equipped, the taking lens and a zoom photography drive controller, a CCD element or a CMOS image sensor1103, an imaging parameter measuring unit1104an image signal processing circuit1105, a store1106, a control signal generator1107for generating control signals for controlling an imaging process, imaging conditions, etc., of a display1108, which also serves as a viewfinder, such as an EVF (Electronic View Finder), a flash unit1109and a recording medium. The subject detection or subject recognition device1111includes the visual axis detector3902, an optical eyepiece system3903for detecting visual axes, and a fixation region setting control means3901, The optical eyepiece system3903is mainly formed by an eyepiece, an optical divider such as a half mirror, a condenser lens, and an illumination light source such as an infrared light emitting diode or LED. The visual axis detector3902is mainly constituted by a mirror, a focusing disk, a pentaprism, a photoelectric converter, and a signal processor. Visual axis position detection signals are from the imaging parameter measuring unit1104output. The visual axis detector3902may use the same in Applicant's Patent No. 2505,854, Appl. No. 2763296 or Appl. No. 2941847 or another similar configuration. The description of the configuration is therefore omitted. A specific attention control procedure will now be described. First, a user extracts by means of the visual axis detector3902a location or region of interest to the user, and the information is stored in a primary memory. Then, the fixing region setting control means becomes3901operated to preferably search for a fixation candidate position or positions stored in advance. The preferred search is similar to the determination of fixation positions based on the ranking as described in connection with the eighth embodiment. For example, the fixation positions are set in accordance with the order of positions to which the user pays attention, and for each fixation position, the search in an adjacent region described mainly in the seventh embodiment is implemented within a predetermined time range. Thereafter, the updating of the position that the user pays attention to and the search in an adjacent region are alternately repeated for the reason to be described later. Alternatively, the signals from the visual axis detector3902are supplied at predetermined time intervals while the fixing region setting control means3901in operation, and the search can be preferably implemented in the peripheral areas of the positions which the user pays attention to, and which are obtained from the signals. To be more specific, an attention control neuron closest to the fixation position in the image is detected by a signal from the visual axis detector3902is selected, and this Steuerneuron is activated, or a gate opening signal to a gate in a predetermined range of in32shown gate layer3201sent, thereby performing a detection or detection that reflects the position that the user is paying attention to.  consequently was an accurate and rapid capture and detection of a subject using the results of capturing the positions, on which the user is looking at as support information. In accordance With the embodiments described above, the Festlegesteuerung a region to look at, with higher efficiency with a small scale Circuit can be achieved without low-order features, such as an edge when capturing an object has no meaning, to be distracted. The multi-resolution processing and the population coding mechanism involved in attention control integrated, in which the received from upper layers feedback levels become involved. Therefore, even if a variety objects belonging to the same category in different sizes at random positions exist, an efficient search among the multiple objects through the mechanism to execute a feedback control using the detection levels of high order features be performed. Pulse signals which feature detection signals become the threshold operation subjected to weighted load sums in time windows. This makes it is possible reliable and efficiently a desired one To capture patterns even if there are a variety of to be detected or objects to be recognized and the relationship between this is unknown in advance, or even if the objects due of positional changes, a rotation, etc., or resize deform, or a defect in detecting a Feature due to the influences the lighting, from noise or the like under complicated, various conditions occurs. This advantage can be without the need of relying on any particular network structure become. The Setting and updating fixation regions can be done quickly and easily reliable by combining the support information (For example, the direction of a visual axis) of a user and the fixation region setting control processing. The Search in fixation regions based on the detection levels high-order features can be performed with high efficiency, which is a rapid detection and detection of one to a predetermined Category belonging Object using a compact system configuration. The Fixation regions are only for Low order features or set for input data, eliminating the need for scheduling for features is bypassed low to high order, which in the state of Technology performed became (the selective tuning method and in the Japanese tested Patent publication No. 6-34236 disclosed prior art). This arrangement leads to higher processing efficiency and to higher Speed. Either the degrees of salience of features of low order or as well as feedback signals are used in a mixed way. This arrangement makes it possible an adaptive processing in accordance with a detection or detection mode. To the Example will be the information regarding patterns that make up the elements provide that form an object to be recognized or local Feature arrays are preferably used in a recognition mode, in which detailed pattern analyzes are performed while general Features (for example, high-order features or the feedback signals of upper layers) is preferably handled in a detection mode in which a simple capture of a pattern leading to a belongs to certain feature category, carried out becomes. The priority levels for fixation positions are determined in advance, and fixation positions are set to the basis of the results of the preset priority levels controlled. This arrangement allows extremely prompt seek control in fixation regions. The allowed areas of priority levels for fixation positions will be in accordance changed with the number of searches for fixation positions. Therefore can be useful when finding an object to be recognized is repeatedly performed at the same position, the allowable range of priority levels changed to change the essential search area. On The basis of the distribution of priority levels becomes the fixation positions set in descending order of priority levels. The size of a Fixation region is controlled by the processing channel, too which is the feature selected on the basis of the priority levels heard, controlled. This arrangement makes it possible the fixation region for the size of a Object also automatically set if the size of the object to be detected or to be detected is not known in advance is. fixing regions are used as active receive fields of the feature entry elements, in the controlling the determination of the fixation regions to a Low-order feature acquisition layer belong, handled. This makes it possible Fixation regions without the need of providing any which special gate elements for fixing fixation regions set. A Variety of features will be for each extracted from a variety of resolutions or scale levels, which allows a highly efficient search for objects of any size becomes. The priority will do the feedback inputs given by upper layers when looking for an object, while the priority the feedback inputs is given by intermediate layers, if the projecting object is recognized. Thus, the search can be based on characteristics high order or general characteristics of a sample, if only the detection of an object that is at a predetermined Heard category, carried out becomes. Detailed processing based on middle features, including the information regarding a pattern that forms part of an entire object, or the information regarding an arrangement relationship of features, can be performed if an object is to be distinguished or recognized among similar objects is. If a predetermined degree of attention is high, the temporal variation of the position of the center of a fixation region is reduced. Therefore, the fluctuation of a fixation position during a vi  The search is made variable in order to realize a higher efficiency of the search on the basis of the degree of gaze and a shortened search time. The Sizes of Fixation regions are based on acquired scale levels set of patterns that belong to the category of a recognizable Object belong. With this arrangement, even if the size of an object in advance not known, one in advance through a processing channel assigned size as one assumed size used which allows highly efficient definition of a fixation region size becomes. One Degree of attention is called a monotonous increase function the amplitude of a feedback signal defined by an upper layer. Thus, a higher detection level becomes a high-order feature as a higher level of attention considered, and may be based on automatic processing of the high-order feature. The Carry out an operation control based on the output signals The above pattern recognition device allows the input an image of a given subject promptly in any one Distance to the subject with reduced power consumption too achieve. Such image input equipment includes a photographing device for still pictures, animated images, three-dimensional images, etc., a copier, a fax machine, a Printers, and other types of equipment containing an image input unit integrate. It can search with high efficiency for an object to be photographed and optimal automatic photographing for the captured Object can be fixed by specifying a fixation region that has a predetermined Requirement fulfilled, and by running centering a controller for optimizing photographic conditions around the fixed fixation region can be implemented. The Update or set a fixation region based on the support information, such as a detected visual axis, of a user allows fixing a fixation region promptly and quickly to quickly track a predetermined pattern."

Magnetic resonance technology is a known technique for ge examining images of a body's interior the object. Here, a static basic magnetic field generated by a basic magnetic field tem is generated, quickly switched gradient fields over supports that are generated by a gradient system. Further the magnetic resonance device comprises a radio frequency system which for triggering magnetic resonance signals high-frequency signals radiates into the object and the generated magnetic resonance signal nale records, on the basis of which magnetic resonance images are created become. In one embodiment, the high-frequency system comprises one stationary antenna, for example as a so-called Whole body antenna is designed as a transmitting and as Receiving antenna can be used. Beyond that so-called to improve a signal-to-noise ratio Local antennas used. These are antennas, to a size of an area of the object to be imaged are adjusted. For example, there is one location device or built-in fixed position local antennas that can be snapped onto the mounting device for example to examine a spine or one female breast. On the other hand, there are also freely movable ones Local antennas, e.g. B. flexible antennas and extremities NEN. In one embodiment, the local antenna can be used as one pure receiving antenna can be formed, for example  the stationary antenna is used as a transmitting antenna becomes. By positioning the area to be imaged in one Imaging volume of the device depends on length and the mass of the object as well as the type of the object to be imaged Range attenuates the receiving antenna. To achieve one Good image quality is done in one embodiment Dampening balanced by taking the picture in front preparatory process a matching device of the recipient ne is set accordingly. Furthermore, the Improve the picture quality with local receiving antennas balancing within a normalization filter performed by magnetic resonance images. To do this, the Norma lization filter Signal intensities from areas close to antennas area of the area to be imaged and raises the signal intensities from areas away from the antenna of the subject Range. It becomes particularly mild when used ner sequence techniques one necessary for image normalization dig characteristic of the receiving antenna from the device automatically determined. Furthermore, a magnetic resonance examination of a patient to limit an irradiated Hochfre performance on a patient that is harmless to the patient ent specific limit (specific absorption rate) Device a patient's mass and age or date of birth ten communicated. For generating magnetic resonance images of the Be to be imaged The magnetic resonance device becomes rich due to an operator ner controlled sequence of the device controlled. The Enter operator a sequence type. For example a spi nechosesequence, a gradient echo sequence, a multi-echosis sequence, a sequence with preparation for magnetization, a Echoplanar sequence, etc. For the selected sequence type are Sequence parameters adjustable by the operator, for example a repetition time, an echo time, a matrix size of the  Magnetic resonance image, a field of view, a thickness of one layer to be recorded, a flip angle, etc. DE 198 18 292 A1 describes a method for controlling a Sequence for a magnetic resonance device described in which a Sequence program specified in the form of a k-space structure , a user of the magnetic resonance device taking a measurement protocol, e.g. B. lumbar spine, and select thereupon a standard for a sequence that for this anatomi usually provides the best results, is displayed on the magnetic resonance device. Thereby belong to the Sequence still various parameters, such as repetition time, Echo time, field of view, layer thickness, matrix size and flip angles selected and displayed according to the standard become. With a predominant number of magnetic resonance examinations conditions are routine examinations, for example of a patient's cervical spine, knee, or head, for which regardless of the different patients to be examined reproducible high magnetic resonance image quality is striving. The image quality achieved is of experience depending on the operator. An inexperienced For example, the operator is the same for every patient selected sequence parameters to examine what is going to vary depending on the patient leads to very different image qualities. A similar one The effect occurs that the magnetic resonance devices Operators, for example doctors and medical-technical Employees, change frequently, so that the individual operator are often insufficiently incorporated. An object of the invention is therefore an improved To create procedures of the type mentioned, with the among other things, a reproducible high magnetic resonance image quality is achievable. The object is achieved by the subject of Claim 1 solved. Advantageous configurations are in the Subclaims described. According to claim 1, a method for generating magnetic resonance images of an object with a magnetic resonance device based on a sequence within the scope of an examination of the object includes the following steps: - The magnetic resonance device is at least one size supplied at least one object-specific parameter, where Mass, length, gender, age or date of birth, stature, Fat percentage and proton density of the object are assigned to fish parameters, - The magnetic resonance device is at least one piece of information for at least one examination-specific parameter supplied with a sequence type, a contrast selection and an area of the object to be imaged the examination spec specific parameters are assigned, and - The magnetic resonance device determines for the combination supplied size and information for generating the magnet resonance images optimal settings and / or settings range of sequence parameters, one field of view, one Repetition time, an echo time, a matrix size, a Di a layer to be imaged, a number of means conditions and a bandwidth and / or a cut-off of a normal tion filters are assigned to the sequence parameters. This makes it independent of different types investigating objects and regardless of experience of a each operator of the magnetic resonance device a reprodu achievable high quality for all magnetic resonance images. The are with regard to a high magnetic resonance image quality optimal settings and / or setting ranges automatically determined by the magnetic resonance device. Further advantages, features and details of the invention result from the execution described below examples based on the drawing. Show: Fig.1 is a sketch of a magnetic resonance device and FIG.2 is a flowchart for a method for determining the optimum settings and / or setting of sequence parameters. Fig.1 shows a sketch of a magnetic resonance apparatus. The device for generating a basic magnetic field comprises a basic field magnet system1and for generating gradient fields a gradient coil system2. To radiate high-frequency signals, the device comprises a stationary antenna3and a local antenna4for receiving the magnetic resonance signals generated thereby. To control currents in the gradient coil system2based on a selected sequence, the gradient coil system2 isconnected to a central control system6. To control the radio frequency signals to be radiated according to the selected sequence and for further processing and storage of the magnetic resonance signals picked up by the antennas3or4, the antennas3and4 arealso connected to the central control system6. Furthermore, the device comprises a movable storage device5on which a patient11to be examined is supported. In this case, the local antenna4is designed to snap into the movable position device5. To control a method of the movable positioning device5, for example to position an area of the patient11to be imaged in an imaging volume8 ofthe device, the positioning device5is also correspondingly connected to the central control system6. The central control system6is connected to a display and operating device7, via which an operator inputs, for example the desired sequence type and sequence parameters, are fed to the central control system6. Furthermore, the generated magnetic resonance images are displayed on the display and control device7. FIG.2 shows a flow chart for a method for determining optimal settings and / or setting ranges for sequence parameters. In this case, the magnetic resonancedeviceshown inFIG.1 is used as an example. In the first two steps21and21'of the flowchart, object- and / or examination-specific parameters are entered by the operator on the magnetic resonance device, possibly with the aid of further measuring devices, and / or are automatically determined by the magnetic resonance device after a start signal triggered by the operator, for example , As already described at the beginning of each magnetic resonance examination of a patient to limit a radiated high-frequency power to a patient-specific limit value which is harmless to the patient, the device communicates a mass and an age or date of birth of the patient11, for example by the operator. In another embodiment, the aforementioned object-specific parameters are tapped by the magnetic resonance device from a patient database which is correspondingly coupled to the central control system6. In a similar way to the object-specific age and mass parameters, the object-specific parameters of length, gender and stature can also be used. Furthermore, a fat percentage and a proton density of the patient11or of the area to be imaged are determined and entered as object-specific parameters. A Fettan part can for example be determined by the operator using a measuring device touching the skin of the patient11prior to the magnetic resonance examination and entered on the display and operating device7. The proton density is determined, for example, by taking an overview image after positioning the region of the patient11 to beimaged in the imaging volume8 ofthe device. In another embodiment, parameters such as the stature in an initial method of the positioning device5into the basic field magnet system1 aredetermined by scanning in a suitably equipped magnetic resonance device. Furthermore, in step21'of the flowchart inFIG.2, depending on the diagnostic requirements, the operator selects a sequence type, for example a spin echo sequence, a gradient echo sequence, a multi-echo sequence, a sequence with preparation for magnetization, an echoplanar sequence, etc., in connection with a contrast preselection with regard to a T1or T2weighting or a mixed weighting on the operating and display device7. At the beginning of a magnetic resonance examination, the patient11 is supportedon the positioning device5,which is extended as far as possible from the basic field magnet system1. The patient11 is positionedaccording to the area to be imaged, which is fixed at the start of the examination. For example, if the cervical spine of the patient11 isto be imaged, the patient11 isstored head-first on the storage device5. Depending on the diagnostic requirements, it is still possible to choose whether the patient11 is placedon his back or on his stomach. The area to be mapped and / or the type of positioning of the patient11are entered accordingly as examination-specific parameters on the display and operating device7by the operator. An organ of the patient11to be examined can also be specified to supplement or replace the aforementioned examination-specific parameters. For the actual implementation of the examination, the positioning device5 is movedsuch that the area to be imaged is positioned in the imaging volume8 ofthe device. An overview picture is then taken, taking into account the parameters that have already been determined and entered. Before taking anatomical and / or functional magnetic resonance images, optimal settings and / or setting ranges of sequence parameters are now determined in a step22 ofthe flowchart from the object and / or examination-specific parameters with regard to a good magnetic resonance image quality and the operator Display and control device7for accepting, selecting, changing and rejecting offered. A field of view, a repetition time, an echo time, a matrix size, a number of averages, a thickness of a layer to be imaged and a cut-off and / or a bandwidth of a normalization filter are important sequence parameters for the image quality. If the patient is a heavyweight, for example, and if the local antenna4 is usedas the receiving antenna, the operator is recommended to use the normalization filter to make settings with small values for the bandwidth and the cut-off of the filter. The optimal settings and / or setting ranges of the Sequence parameters are based on changed framework conditions conditions, for example after a contrast medium administration changed framework conditions adapted again offered. In In one embodiment there is also an optimal contrast proposed amount. In one embodiment, a combination of object and / or examination-specific parameters is assigned the optimal settings and / or setting ranges of the sequence parameters via a table link. In this case, a table on which the aforementioned link is based is generated, for example as part of a series of tests and / or on the basis of empirical values, and stored in the central control system6. The table can be expanded with each new examination. The assignment based on the table is explained below as an example for a T2-weighted spine examination of a normal-weight and an overweight patient. The normal-weight patient is identified as such on the basis of the object-specific parameters entered by the operator, length 1.6 m and mass 60 kg. Furthermore, the operator's age and / or date of birth, the gender and a position of the normal-weight patient are entered on the bearing device5with the head first and lying on the back. For the aforementioned combination of object-specific and examination-specific parameters, the optimal settings and / or setting ranges for the sequence parameters, which are offered to the operator on the display and operator device7, are stored in accordance with the table stored in the central control system6. For example, thirteen are offered as a number of layers to be imaged and two as a number of averages. In contrast to the normal weight patient, the length 1.8 m and the mass 100 kg are entered for the heavy patient. Because of a higher fat signal to be expected and a longer length of the heavy-weight patient compared to the normal-weight patient, the number of slices to be imaged with fifteen and the number of averages with three compared to the normal-weight patient with larger numbers are offered as sequence parameters according to the tabular link. In another embodiment, a neural network implemented in the central control system6for combinations of object and / or examination-specific parameters determines the optimal settings and / or setting ranges of the sequence parameters. For this purpose, the neural network for feeding a sufficiently long learning phase is fed with a sufficiently large number of combinations in conjunction with a statement as to whether a good or bad image quality is achieved thereby. The neural network keeps learning with each new examination. In one embodiment, the operator is offered a help function when changing sequence parameters, which indicates the optimal settings and / or setting ranges for high image quality. If, for example, a T1-weighted spin echo sequence is preselected and the operator increases the repetition time in such a way that the T1contrast behavior is lost, the operator is informed accordingly by the help function. In a further embodiment, the Sequence parameters and a start of the actual images The patient's movements are at least indicated because these also lead to impairments of the image quality can."

407,FI-112383-B,Method for Improving Cathode Quality in Electrolysis ,2001,"112383 METHOD FOR IMPROVING CATHODE QUALITY IN ELECTROLYSIS The method is directed to improving the quality of cathodes used in the electrolysis process. The surface of the cathode lifted out of the pool during the cathode cycle is imaged by a camera and the physical quality of the cathode can be determined in real time by image analysis equipment. Based on the cathode surface quality, it is possible to monitor and control electrolysis conditions to improve cathode quality. Particularly well, process 10 is suitable for electrolytic purification of copper. In electrolytic treatment of metals, the desired metal is deposited on the surface of the electrode, the cathode. The treatment is carried out by means of an electric current in an electrolysis pool in which a fluid, an electrolyte, is immersed alternately in a plurality of plate-shaped anodes and plate-shaped cathodes made of an electrically conductive material. The desired metal can be precipitated on the cathode either by using a soluble anode of the same metal to be precipitated in the electrolytic treatment or by using an insoluble anode. A soluble anode is used, for example, in the alloying of copper and; 20 insoluble anodes, for example, when precipitating nickel or zinc. i "": In the electrolytic purification of copper, the impure anode copper is solubilized by electric current and the dissolved copper is reduced on the cathode plate as a very pure so-called cathode copper. · 'Of steel or titanium. Powered by one or more of the following: .i,: rectifiers. typically varies from 30 to 60 pairs per plant, and there are varying amounts of electrolysis pools in the plants, typically 14 to 21 days, with a cathode cycle of 7 to 10 days. 112383 2 The production capacity of the electrolysis plant depends on the current used in the electrolysis, the number of electrolysis pools and the time and current efficiency of the plant. The efficiencies describe how well the plant's pools are in use (in power) over time and how well the electrical current is used to deposit copper. The capacity of the electrolysis plants will be increased by increasing the current density used, constructing more electrolysis pools or improving efficiency. The patent application WO-0135083 describes a method for checking the surface quality of a finished cathode produced by electrolysis, according to which each cathode is inspected before the precipitate is removed from the motherboard. In the method, the surface of the cathode is illuminated by at least one light source in an oblique direction with respect to the path of the cathode pathway, whereby surface irregularities 15 form shadows on the surface of the cathode. The inspection station has a camera depicting the illuminated cathode surface. The resulting image is further transmitted to an image processing device for processing the image by measuring the physical properties of the shadows caused by the irregularities. Cathode Quality Grade · [”: Performed on the basis of shadow properties. 20: During the cathode cycle, it is difficult to collect real-time information on cathode quality during electrolysis. This creates one of the biggest problems for the process in terms of process control and production control. The quality information is typically obtained only after the product, the cathode metal, has been completed and the quality of the product can no longer be affected in any way. As mentioned above, the cathode period '' lasts for several days, and thus information on disturbances affecting the cathode quality is obtained only through the final quality, i. .: All information is obtained with a long delay. i; In electrolysis experiments, it has been found that there is a clear correlation between the cathode surface quality and the crystal structure. There is also a correlation between the crystal structure and the chemical quality: the coarser the crystal structure, the more impurities remain in the cathode in the form of solution inclusions. The crystalline structure is influenced by the driving parameters of the electrolysis: current density, electrolyte temperature and the additives used in the process play an important role. Additives are the most difficult to analyze, and the ratio of additives in the electrolyte also affects the crystal structure. The method according to the invention is intended to obtain information on the surface quality of the cathode already during the cathode cycle and thereby eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks. The method describes the surface of the cathode lifted from the electrolysis pool during the growth period, and the resulting image is analyzed and classified by image analysis software. By comparing the image with the previously created reference classification, the electrolysis process is adjusted to produce a good quality cathode. The essential features of the invention will be apparent from the appended claims. 15 The invention relates to a method by which the quality of a cathode surface can be studied in real time during a cathode cycle, and on the basis of this information influence the control quantities of electrolysis. Thus, for example, additive feeds can be made even during the first day of growth, ·: 20, to provide better cathodes. i: According to the method, the quality of the cathode surface is determined by image * 'based hardware consisting of at least one' ··· 'camera, image processing software and hardware, and hardware used to locate the camera. Preferably, the camera is a digital> I 1 I 1 or video camera that, in accordance with a pre-designed design, captures an image of a cathode surface temporarily lifted from an electrolysis pool. Of course, the camera can also be an analog video camera or a digital camera. Image analysis provides real-time information on cathode growth. 30th A method according to the invention is capable of detecting, for example, process and quality disturbances at an early stage, and corrective measures can be initiated much earlier than the present situation. The method can be utilized in other process control activities, and based on the measurement data it provides, cathode quality predictive models can be made from other process measurements. 5 The operation of the process according to the invention takes place as follows. The cathode momentarily lifted from the electrolysis pool is imaged by means of a camera. The camera image is transmitted to image analysis software consisting of, for example, the Angle Measure Technique (AMT) and Principal Component Analysis (Partial Least Squares) and possibly the Self-Organizing Neural Network (SOM). Thus, image analysis and data classification techniques are used to process the image information of the cathode surface. After imaging, the cathode is returned to the electrolysis pool. The result obtained by the method is class-type, that is to say, with the aid of the above 15 software, cathodes of different growth types are initially classified into different reference classes. A predictive model for cathode growth is then created. After the model is created, the software compares the image from the cathode with the finished class images and adjusts the process according to the instructions given for each class • ...; based on the right area, either manually or automatically. : 20 «I> I« 1 »* ♦ #"

436,AT-411415-B,METHOD AND DEVICE FOR GENERATING AN AC VOLTAGE FOLLOWING AN INPUT DATA CURRENT ,2001,"<Desc / Clms Page number 1>         The invention relates to a method for generating a powerful an input data stream, eg. B. in Sony Consumer Standard @ 2s format, the following AC voltage according to the preamble of claim 1, and a device for performing the method.       In the consumer audio sector, for example, the power for the loudspeakers is transmitted via correspondingly voluminous copper wires. In addition to high costs, these cables also act as transmit antennas for high-frequency interference when switching amplifiers, so-called D amplifiers, are used. As part of a larger, progressive concept, a D amplifier, to which a digital data stream is fed via fiber optics, is built into the loudspeaker housing. The D-amplifier of such a loudspeaker is supplied by means of a mains connection, and must also meet strict electromagnetic standards with the environment with regard to the mains feedback.       In known solutions of this type, the input data stream is always converted into an analog signal, which is then amplified and the amplified signal is subsequently converted back into a digital signal. However, a loss of quality due to repeated implementation cannot be avoided.       In addition, the efficiency of non-switching analog amplifiers is relatively low at around 50%.      On the other hand, more than 90% is already achieved with power electronics or switching amplifiers. With the D amplifier, an analog voltage at the input is modulated with a fixed frequency, the switching frequency of the D amplifier, pulse widths (PWM). This PWM voltage is amplified in the PWM output stage of the D amplifier by switching transistors on and off with high efficiency. The filter size of a D amplifier is determined by the lower hearing threshold (15 Hz). The efficiency is significantly influenced by the switching frequency. The switching frequency must be a multiple of the upper hearing threshold (20 kHz).       The spectrum of the amplified PWM voltage naturally has a high switching frequency component and high harmonic components, which now have to be completely filtered out again in order to obtain a powerful, undistorted analog voltage at the load. It is necessary to avoid pulse inaccuracies by appropriate feedback.       D-amplifiers with an analog input and passive filters are known from the prior art.      The phase shift of a bandpass filter and the complex loudspeaker load very quickly set the strong negative feedback, desirable for low distortions, due to instabilities.       Another problem with known D-type amplifiers of this type is that DC voltage supplies, which essentially draw a sinusoidal current from a network, so-called power factor correction circuits (hereinafter referred to as PFC for short) provide rippled DC voltage, which is a considerable one Ripple portion, or has ripple. The ripple has a frequency that corresponds to 2n times the frequency of the network, where n is the number of phases of the network connected to a full-wave rectifier circuit.      A noticeable ripple in the voltage supply makes it difficult to amplify the input signal largely without distortion. To smooth the ripple, DCDC stages are common, but they require a relatively high level of circuitry.       The aim of the invention is to avoid these disadvantages and to propose a method of the type mentioned at the beginning which enables amplification with sinusoidal current consumption of the DC voltage supply from the network with high efficiency, the amplified voltage corresponding very precisely to the input data stream ,       According to the invention, this is achieved in a method of the type mentioned at the outset by the characterizing features of claim 1.       The proposed measures prevent conversion into an analog signal and at the same time ensure that the amplified signal largely corresponds to the input data stream even when the DC voltage supply is sinusoidal, or if the DC voltage applied to the D-amplifier ripples considerably equivalent.       The amplified output signal can be derived using any algorithm. For example, the derivation of a digital signal from the amplified output    <Desc / Clms Page number 2>   signal according to the algorithm of an adaptive delta modulation, a superimposed algorithm for reducing the effective switching frequency can also be provided, or according to an advanced pulse code modulation. The algorithms given above are only examples.       Another object of the invention is to propose a device for carrying out the method according to the invention.       Starting from a device according to the preamble of claim 2, the characterizing features of claim 2 are therefore proposed.       The proposed measures result in a very simple structure, with the digital control loop ensuring a very precise comparison of the amplified voltage with the input data stream. Fluctuations in the DC voltage supply of the D amplifier are also recognized and taken into account.       Without the addition of the signal corresponding to the ripple of the DC voltage supply to the input signal or a signal derived therefrom, the controller would only notice fluctuations in the DC voltage supply after the signal has passed through the device, and filters may also be provided. Within the lead time, all changes in the supply voltage would therefore be passed on directly to the load as amplitude modulation. The proposed measures ensure that changes in the supply voltage to the amplifier stage are counteracted. As a result, the circuitry complexity for the voltage supply can be kept low, even if it consumes an essentially sinusoidal current and therefore only causes a slight network reaction.     So it can be found with simple PFC circuits.       The features of claim 3 result in the advantage that an adaptation to the conditions from the area downstream of the actuator is also possible. This is e.g. B. advantageous in audio systems. So it is possible for the sound reinforcement of a disco the increasing attenuation changes in attenuation and thus changes in the actuator, z. B. a speaker to compensate downstream signal path.       Due to the features of claim 4, the demands on the power supply decrease with little digital circuitry.       The proposed measures can also be used to detect and correct fluctuations in the supply voltage of the power unit. In addition, the voltage source can be constructed more simply and z. B. can only be realized by a simple PFC connected downstream of a rectifier circuit. The computing effort for the comparator and controller can be implemented rather slowly in the microprocessor or quickly in a circuit-programmable IC in a hard-wired computing circuit. Given the high conversion speeds of today's AD converters (eg 90 MHz), a sufficiently short loop throughput time can already be achieved in the latter case, so that a pulse pattern correction is then also carried out with this controller structure.       If filter distortions are also to be corrected, the problem of phase rotation must be solved. This is done in the control loop according to claim 5.       The phase shift can be compensated for by means of a timing element which is very easy to carry out in digital technology. The controller is informed of the setpoint delayed by the filter runtime, so that it arrives at the same time as the feedback digitized output voltage.      As a result, the controller works stably.       Methods are known in which filter distortions are accepted and a fast control loop for pulse pattern generation is provided, which requires an analog input signal.       The features of claim 6 make it possible to generate a pulse pattern, the digital input data stream being processed with high congruence to form a powerful PWM output voltage, and a quality-reducing digital / analog conversion can be dispensed with.       A high-quality energy supply and a correspondingly complex D / A converter (filter) are necessary for high quality requirements.       However, the controller only notices fluctuations in the supply voltage after the cycle time of the D / A converter or filter. All changes to the    <Desc / Clms Page number 3>   Supply voltage passed directly to the load as amplitude modulation, which manifests itself in an insufficient supply voltage rejection (SVR).       Combinations of several control loops according to claims 7 to 9 appear advantageous.       The features of claim 7 result in savings in energy supply and the features in claim 8 result in savings in the D / A converter.       It is particularly advantageous to provide the features of claim 9, which result in savings in the energy supply and D / A converter.       Acceptable results are currently achieved with a negative feedback network to compensate for the switching time errors and complex, tolerance-sensitive and necessarily multi-stage filters and a correspondingly high switching frequency. The fast inner control loop for the pulse pattern correction of the amplifier stage previously required an analog signal or the D / A conversion of a digital input data stream. The required switching frequency of well over 100 kHz and the associated fast commutation processes in the amplifier stage make it more difficult to comply with the standards that have been binding for all products put into circulation in the EEA since January 2, 1996, in particular EN 50081 with regard to Interference emissions from electromagnetic fields.       Due to the features of claim 10 or 11, the D-amplifier can have at least the same quality of the output signal compared to the single-stage solution, e.g. due to the phase-shifted clocking of n power units 5 connected in parallel with the nth of the switching frequency. The switching processes can run more slowly without loss of quality. This increases the electromagnetic compatibility. The switching losses increase, the efficiency remains high compared to the A amplifier. At higher powers (currently around 5 kW upwards), relief circuits can also be used due to the reduced switching frequency, which increases the power density (power that can be transferred per volume of power parts).       In addition, the advantages can be exploited that result from the interconnection of several D amplifier stages without increasing the computing power of the digital control unit by a corresponding multiple. The amplifier stages can be constructed relatively simply.       The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the drawing. Show: 1 shows a first embodiment of an amplifier arrangement, 2 to 4 embodiments of a control device, 5 to 8 different embodiments of amplifier arrangements, 9 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a device according to the invention, 10 and 11 further embodiments of a control device, 12 shows an exemplary embodiment for a power section of a D amplifier stage, Fig. 13 schematically shows a controller and 14 shows a further exemplary embodiment of an amplifier arrangement.       Digital data streams with hatched bars and analog data streams with simple lines are shown in all the figures.       The amplifier arrangement or device according to FIG. 1 has an amplifier stage V5, which is shown in more detail in FIG. 8, and which has a control loop 2 or a predictor 2 'which is connected upstream of the amplifier stage V5 to which an actuator 9, for. B. a speaker is connected via an output terminal 8.       The amplifier stage V5 essentially has a series circuit 3 of a mixer 67, which comes from an input data stream 1 'coming from the control loop 2 or the predictor 12, the predictor 12 can also be connected upstream of the control loop 2, and a data stream 61 which, as still will be explained, which corresponds to the ripple of a DC voltage supply of a D-amplifier 5, generates a data stream 1 ″, and an encoder 68, which converts the data stream 1 ″ into a digital signal train 4. This functional block, consisting of the mixer 67 and the encoder, is referred to below as the mixer-encoder circuit 3. This circuit 3 is followed by a D amplifier 5, which amplifies the digital signal train and applies it to a D / A converter 7, which can also be designed as a filter circuit.       The control loop 2 is connected via an A / D converter 20 and a line 31 to the output    <Desc / Clms Page number 4>   terminal 8 connected. The predictor 12 upstream of the control loop 2 is not absolutely necessary, an input of the predictor 12 being acted upon by a signal coming from a microphone 80. This allows changes in an actuator connected to the device, e.g. B. a speaker 9, downstream signal path, z. B. a room sounded by the loudspeaker, e.g. B. a disco, z. B. are caused by a change in the number of people in this room. A larger change in the number of people in a sound-affected room changes the damping and thus the characteristics of the signal path downstream of the loudspeaker.       For example, the control loop can be supplied with a signal from a loudspeaker set up in a disco, which serves as an actuator 9, or from the disco itself. In this case, not only can any distortions caused by the amplifier stage V5 be corrected, but also distortions and influences caused by the downstream route, such as. B. the number of dependent attenuation in the sonicated room.       In this embodiment, the control loop 2 and the predictor 12 are connected upstream of the amplifier stage V5, so that there is one in front of the input data stream 1, 1 ', which precedes in the form of data words with a predetermined number of bits and on the control loop 2, respectively Predictor 12 is present, changed data stream 1 ""is present.       A predictor 12 at most temporarily requires a feedback, so that the connection between the microphone 80 and the corresponding input of the predictor 12 can also be temporarily interrupted by means of a switch (not shown). The predictor 12 forms the inverse function of the system behavior z. B. mathematically. It can also consist of a so-called neural network that has the ability to learn, or it can also consist of a cell capable of learning. The basics and theory of neural networks and their structure are known from the relevant literature and do not form part of the invention.       The advantage of a predictor 12 is its robustness against interference, since it does not need constant feedback, and in the expanded possibilities that arise in particular in the case of a neural network capable of learning.       However, a predictor cannot compensate for the noise of a system that changes over time, such as thermal drift, switching time jitter, etc. The transmission behavior of a controlled system that is unchanged over time is realized by means of at least temporary feedback.       For this purpose, the control loop 2 constantly requires the feedback of the signal tapped from point 4 'or of an amplified signal tapped from point 6' and attenuated via the attenuator 10 (FIG. 5). In the circuit according to FIG. 1, the control loop 2 can be designed differently, different examples being shown in FIGS. 2 to 4.       In the embodiment according to FIG. 1, a full-wave rectifier 62, which draws an essentially sinusoidal current from the network 63, is provided for the energy supply of the D amplifier 5 and is connected to a network 63. This rectifier 62 is followed by a power factor correction circuit PFC, which supplies the supply lines 55, 56 of the D amplifier 5.       Capacitors 41, 42 are connected to these two supply lines 55, 56, both of which are connected to ground 40. Furthermore, a voltage divider 64, 65 is connected to the supply lines 55, 56, the center tap 66 of which is connected via a line 59 to an A / D converter 60, the data stream 61 of which is fed to the mixer 67 of the mixer coding circuit 3 ,       Fluctuations in the DC voltage supplying the D amplifier 5 are fed into the control of the D amplifier 5 via the A / D converter 60 and the mixer 67. This prevents the fluctuations in the supply voltages from leading to amplitude modulation of the amplified signal.       2 shows the basic structure of a first embodiment R1 of a control loop 2. In this embodiment, a controller 13, a coding device 16 and a pulse error comparator 14 are provided. The input data stream 1, or input data stream 1 'of a predictor 12, and the output signal 17 of the encoder 16 are present at the inputs of the controller 13. This converts the digital signal train 15 coming from the comparator 14 into an error data stream 17 which influences the controller 13.    <Desc / Clms Page number 5>          The comparator 14 is supplied with an output signal from the mixer coding circuit 3 and a signal 11 from the attenuator 10 (not shown in FIG. 2), the attenuator 10 preferably being connected to point 6 'of the amplifier stage. The comparator .14 can preferably be an XOR operation. The coding device 16 can be a time-limited up-down counter.       The controller 13 generates an output data stream 1 ″ from the input data stream 1 or the data stream 1 ′ and the error data stream 17. The data streams 1 ″ and 61, which corresponds to the fluctuations in the DC supply voltage of the D-amplifier 5, are generated by the mixer -Coding circuit 3 of the amplifier stage to a digital signal train 4 processed. The controller 13 can also include the mixer 67, the circuit 3 then only comprising an encoder 68.       With the high conversion speeds of today's A / D converter from z. B. 90MHz, the loop throughput time of the controller R1 is sufficiently short so that a pulse pattern correction can be carried out to increase the quality. Changes in the supply voltage of the D amplifier 5 or the intermediate circuit voltage are compensated for by means of the data stream 61 of the A / D converter 60.       The control loop R2 according to FIG. 3 has a comparator 19 and a controller 13. The controller 13 and the comparator 19 process the input data stream 1, 1 ′ and the digital actual data stream 21, which is supplied by a converter 20, which converts the digital signal train 6 into the data stream 21. The comparator 19 generates an error data stream 17 which is fed to the controller 13, which generates a data stream 1 ""which is processed in the downstream amplifier stage, as has already been explained with reference to FIG. 1.       With the control loop R2, fluctuations in the supply voltage of the D amplifier 5 can also be detected and corrected. As a result, the voltage source of the D amplifier 5 can be constructed in a simple manner. The computing effort for the comparator 19 and controller 13 can be rather slow in the microprocessor or fast in a hard-wired computing circuit, e.g. B. a circuit programmable IC, can be realized, a pulse pattern correction is also possible.       The control loop R3 according to FIG. 4 differs from the control loop R2 according to FIG. 3 in that the comparator 19 is supplied with the setpoint or input data stream 1, 1 'with respect to the controller 13 via a timer 22 and at which Input of the converter 20, which converts analog signals into an actual data stream, the output voltage 31 of one or more amplifier stages is present.       A filter characteristic or the path transmission behavior of the downstream amplifier stage can advantageously be compensated in the timing element 22. Based on the comparison of the data streams 18, which the timing element 22 supplies, and 21, which the converter 20 supplies, which arrive at the inputs of the comparator 19 with the same time delay compared to the input data stream 1, 1 ', the controller 13 operates stably , The control enables the use of simpler filters or D / A converters at the output of the amplifier stage. The computing power for the controller R3 is provided by a microprocessor.       In the amplifier stages V2 to V4 according to FIGS. 5 to 7 and V6 according to FIG. 9, the effort required for energy supply and amplification is lower at the expense of an increased effort in low-performance control electronics, which has an ever increasing quality of Output voltage at the load, i. H. the actuator 9 guaranteed.       6 has a control loop R3, a control loop R1, the coding unit 3, a D amplifier 5, a D / A converter 7, an attenuator 10 and a converter 20. The output voltage 6 is fed back to the inputs of the attenuator 10 and the converter 20. The signal 11 at the output of the attenuator 10 is fed to the controller R1. The converter 20 generates the data words of the actual data stream 21 from the voltage 6. The data stream 21 is fed to the control loop R3. The control loop R3 generates from the data streams 1 or 1 ′ and 21 the data stream 1 ″ which is fed to the control loop R1.     In the control loop R1, the data stream 1 ″ ″ is generated from the data stream 1 ″ and the signal 11, and is processed by the coding unit 3 to form the digital signal train 4, which is present at the output of the D amplifier 5 as voltage 6.       The control loop R3 can be designed slower than the control loop R1 and enables    <Desc / Clms Page number 6>   light z. B. the regulation of fluctuations in the supply voltages of the D-amplifier 5 in FIG. 6.       The amplifier stage V4 in FIG. 7 differs from the amplifier stage V3 in that a control loop R2 is additionally provided, which is connected between the control loops R3 and R1. The output voltage of the amplifier stage V4 is fed back to the control loop R3 via the A / D converter 20 ', which generates a data stream 21' from the output voltage 31.       The signal train 6 is on the one hand via the converter 20, which generates a data stream from the amplified signal train 6, which is applied to the control loop R2, which is connected downstream of the control loop R3. Furthermore, the signal train 6 is fed back to the control loop R1, which is connected downstream of the control loop R2, via an attenuator 10, which generates a signal train 11.       The control loop R3 controls according to the output voltage 31 and thereby reduces the demands on the converter 7. The timing element 22 of the control loop R3 can be carried out in digital technology by means of a shift register in a much simpler and higher quality than in analog technology, necessarily multi-stage timer elements.       The functions and the structure of the individual control loops R1, R2, R3 are the same as those described with reference to FIGS. 2 to 4.       When three control loops R1, R2, R3 are arranged, the hardware outlay can be kept low. Filter distortions can also be corrected by the feedback of the output voltage. U. can be dispensed with a filter stage. In addition, a wide variety of filter characteristics can be taken into account in a digitally operating control device without significant additional effort.       FIG. 9 shows an amplifier stage V6 which has a multiplexer 30 and a number n of amplifier stages which can be designed in accordance with the amplifier stages V2 to V5. The multiplexer 30 generates a number of n parts of data streams 1 'from the input data stream 1, each data stream 1' being fed to one of the amplifier stages V2 to V5, the same amplifier stages being expediently provided in each case. The outputs of the n amplifier stages are connected to the output terminal 8 and feed the output voltage 31. The actuator 9, for. B. a loudspeaker is connected either directly via a line 34 or via an interposed filter 33 to the output terminal 8 of the amplifier stage V6.       In the embodiment according to FIG. 9, the D-amplifier can have at least the same quality of the output signal compared to the single-stage solution, e.g. B. due to the phase-shifted clocking of n D-amplifiers 5 connected in parallel with the nth part of the switching frequency. The switching processes can run more slowly without loss of quality. This increases the electromagnetic compatibility. The switching losses increase, the efficiency remains high compared to an A amplifier. With higher performances of z. B. 5kW and more, can also be used due to the reduced switching frequency, relief circuits, whereby the power density per volume of the power parts transferable power is increased.       In the embodiment according to FIG. 10, an amplifier stage V6, which, as can be seen from FIG. 9, comprises a plurality of D amplifiers, is preceded by a regulator R2 or R3 (FIG. 3, FIG. 4), which controls the input data stream 1 and processes the output data stream 21, which is generated by the converter 20, into data stream 35. The voltage at the output terminal 8 of the amplifier stage V6 or the voltage at the load 9 is fed back to the input of the converter 20 by means of a switch 36, which can also be omitted.       In the embodiment according to FIG. 10, the advantages which result from the interconnection of a plurality of D amplifiers can be used without the computing power of the digital control unit having to be increased by a corresponding multiple. The amplifier stage V6 can consist of simple amplifier stages, e.g. B. amplifier stages V5 (Fig. 1).       In the embodiment according to FIG. 10, a changeover switch 32 is also provided, by means of which the output terminal 8 can either be connected via a filter 33 or directly to the load 9.       In the embodiment according to FIG. 11, a predictor 12 is connected upstream of an amplifier stage, which can optionally be an amplifier stage V2, V3, V4, V5 or V6    <Desc / Clms Page number 7>   whose input signals of a microphone 80 can be placed, the z. B. is set up in a sonicated by the load 9, which may be a loudspeaker. A filter 33 is connected downstream of the amplifier stage.       The influence of the route downstream of load 9 can also be recorded. Since the predictor 12 takes into account the behavior of the controlled system comprising the amplifier stage, constant feedback can be dispensed with.       12 shows the exemplary embodiment for the power section 5. The power section 5 is formed, for example, from the voltage supplies 41, 42 and a half-bridge arrangement 43, 44.      The half-bridge arrangement is formed from a main switch 50 and an anti-parallel free-wheeling diode 51 and a further main switch 52 with a further free-wheeling diode 53.       The output of the main switch 50 is connected to the input of the main switch 52 via a line 54. The input of the main switch 50 is connected to the voltage supply 41 via the supply line 55 and the output of the main switch 52 is connected to the voltage supply 42 via the supply line 56.       The voltage supply 42 is connected in series. The line 57 is connected to the power ground 40 at the node 49. Two supply devices 41, 42 connected in series are loaded with the half-bridge arrangement of the circuit breakers 43, 44. Signal 6 is present at the center 48 of the half-bridge arrangement. The reference potential for the powerful voltage 6 is the power mass 40, which is connected to the connection point 49 of the supply devices 41, 42. The low-power signal train 4 is fed to the driver device 45. If the signal 4 is high, the upper switch 43 is switched on by means of non-inverting driver device 47 and the lower switch 44 is switched off by means of inverting driver device 46.       The voltage 6 or 31 is equal to the output voltage of the supply device 41 with respect to the ground 40. If the signal 4 is low, the point 48 is connected to the supply device 42 via the lower switch 44. The voltage 6.31 is equal to the negative output voltage of the supply device 42 with respect to the power mass 40. The low-power signal train 4 is present at the levels of the supply devices 41, 42 with respect to the power mass 40 as a powerful output voltage 6 at the half-bridge center 48 ,       The power section 5 is a device, for. B. realized with the power semiconductors 43,44 in a half-bridge arrangement, for producing positive and / or negative voltage pulses from at least one voltage source, eg. B. 41.42 in which the power supply of a load, for. B. at the powerful output voltage 6, intermittently interrupted with low loss and / or reversed polarity.       The efficiency of the switching amplifier is significantly influenced by the switching frequency.      The switching losses of FET circuit breakers increase disproportionately with the voltage load. At least one low-frequency D amplifier stage V2 to V5 of an amplifier stage V6 supplies power for the bass loudspeakers, while the much smaller power for the tweeters is provided by another D amplifier stage V2 to V5 of the amplifier stage V6, which has a significantly higher switching frequency and smaller supply voltage works.       13 shows an example of the digital implementation of controller R1. The data words of a supplied target data stream 1, e.g. B. in i2s format, z. B. the converter 100 and the prefilter 102, which may also be designed as a decimation filter, may be serially fed to the adder or mixer 13. The mixer 13 has a feedback or negative feedback input to which the error data stream 17 is fed and processes the data words of the input data streams 1 '; 17 to data stream 1 "". The data stream 1"" is converted by the coding device 3 into the digital signal train 4 in such a way that the value of the signal train 4 averaged over the duration of a switching period follows the data stream 1 "".     The digital signal train 4 is amplified by a switching amplifier 5 (see also FIG. 12) to the high-performance output voltage 6, the control device 13 changing the switching time errors or changing the shape of the signal train 4 as a result of different switching times of the switching transistors 43, 44 of the power unit 5 compensated. The digital signal train 4, which corresponds to the data stream 1 ″, is taken over by the D-latch of the converter 100 on each rising edge of the clock signal 110. The converter 100 converts, for example, the digital signal trains of the target data stream 1 in synchronism with the clock signal 110    <Desc / Clms Page number 8>   i2s format into a parallel or serial data stream 101, which is converted by a pre-filter 102 into a data stream 1 'of different resolution and synchronicity.       This data stream 1 'is synchronous with the clock signal 140, for example 176 kHz. This is also the synchronicity of the compensation data stream 17, which is obtained by comparing the digital signal train 4 with the powerful output voltage 6. The compensation data stream 17 is generated by the summer 111, which adds the values of the pulse widths of the error signal 15 digitized by the up-down counter 108 with the correct sign. An integrator that is limited in time to the switching period of the switching frequency can be implemented with the counter 108.       The switching frequency of the D amplifier 5 is derived from the clock signal 120, which is fed to the counter 104 of the coding unit 3. The counter 104 generates the switching frequency clock 140 with which the counter 108 is controlled or reset. The output data stream 107 of the error pulse width digitizer 108 is synchronous with the clock 140. The error pulse width signal 15 is from the comparator 14, here e.g. realized as an XOR gate, to which the digital signal train 4 and the digital output voltage 11 are supplied by the attenuator 10, to which the powerful output voltage 6 is fed back on the input side. The signal 15 at the output of the XOR 14 is high only for the times when its inputs, that is to say the signal 4 and the powerful output voltage 6, have different states.     The data streams 1 'and 17 which are synchronous with the clock 140 are added in the mixer 13 which generates the data stream 1 "".       The words of the data stream 1 ""are checked for equality in the comparator 103 with the values of the data stream 105 which is generated by the counter 104. The counter 104 and the RS flip-flop 106 are controlled (reset) by the clock 140. By means of counter 104 , Comparator 103, RS flip-flop 106 and clock 120, PWM modulation of the data stream 1 ""is carried out.       Fig. 14 shows an embodiment for a D amplifier with sinusoidal current consumption.      The rectifier 62 is connected on the input side to the network 63 and on the output side to the input of the PFC. With sinusoidal current consumption, the PFC regulates the mean value of its output voltage between the lines 55, 56, to which the D amplifier 5, which is formed by the D stages 43, 44, is connected. A voltage divider 64, 65 and a series connection of capacitors 41, 42 are also connected to the two lines 55, 56, the connection point 49 of the two capacitors 41, 42, as well as a connection of the consumer 9, being connected to the ground 40 is. The output 48 of the D amplifier stages 43, 44 is connected via a line 31 to the input of the D / A converter 7, which can also be designed as a filter, and via a line 6 to an attenuator 10, whose output is connected to the control loop R1 is connected.     The control loop R1 processes, as already explained, processes the data stream 1 'with the data stream 11 of the attenuator 10 and the data stream 4, of the encoder 68 of the mixer coding circuit 3 to the data stream 1 "".       At the output of the D / A converter 7, the load 9 is connected, the z. B. can be formed by a loudspeaker.       The voltage at the load is fed back to the control loop R2 via the A / D converter 20, the output data stream 21 of the A / D converter 20 being processed by the control loop R2 with the input data stream 1 to the data stream 1 '.       The voltage divider 64.65 mm connected to the intermediate circuit 55, 56 with the center connection 66 is connected to the input of the A / D converter 60 via the line 59. The output data stream 61 of the D / A converter 60, like the data stream 1 ″, is fed to the mixer 67 of the mixer coding circuit 3.
