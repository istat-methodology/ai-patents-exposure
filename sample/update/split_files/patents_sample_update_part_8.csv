3702,BE-1020635-A3,A METHOD FOR USE WITH A VIDEO DISPLAY SYSTEM CONSISTING OF A VIDEO SCREEN AND A LOT OF COURSE NAVIGATION CONTROLS. ,2012,"A method for use with a video display system consisting of a video screen and a plurality of cursor navigation controls The announcement relates to human behavior, and, more specifically, to a user interface that is optimized for brain task delimitation to mimic experience and buying behavior. The present invention relates to a system for accurately modeling a buyer / purchaser's psychology and arranging content objects in a user-initiated browsing and presentation channel, consisting of a neuropsychological modeling engine, an ranking application, and a behavioral model color that communicate with each other and a presentation system for communication networks. The neuropsychological modeling engine uses metafiles associated with content objects, a buyer / viewer model, and a channel model to derive a value die representing an individual's state of mind and a value m representing an individual's motivational strength to select a content object. If the value Ψ is within an acceptable predetermined range, the value m is used to prepare an arrangement for the content object in relation to other content objects associated with the channel model. Also disclosed are a system and technique for simultaneously presenting multiple data streams with content objects on the user interface in a manner that encourages multidimensional browsing, using traditional navigation controls. Background According to neurophysiology and neuropsychology, a human brain comprises a left hemisphere and a right hemisphere, each with its own personality or consciousness and a separate way of processing information. For simplicity, these will be referred to as the left half and the right half respectively. The left half of the brain is known for analytical, categorical thinking and textual, sequential processing. The right half of the brain is known for plastic, intuitive, holistic thinking and visual-spatial, parallel processing. Therefore, some processes or even simple exposure to certain stimuli will instead activate the right hemisphere and some other place of the left hemisphere. For example, textual information will activate the left hemisphere and visual-spatial information will activate the right hemisphere. Similarly, the action of searching through the menus will rather activate the left half of the brain, while navigating with a joystick through, for example, a landscape or space will activate the right half. Therefore, experiencing interfaces will rather activate the left or right half, depending on the type of elements used for the interfaces: eg visual-spatial elements or the text. Such left-right activation will also depend on the type of actions and thinking that are needed to use these elements. As explained in the rest of this text, hemispheric brain activity can also be linked to human emotions and moods. For example, a product interface can support a certain mood, depending on how the front-end and back-end are designed, and depending on the processes needed to operate such interface. The problem with current human interfaces is that they oblige us to process information or perform actions that are not in line with the voting experience for which the product was designed. Or, in other words, at some point during the user experience, these interfaces tend to activate a part of the brain, which then changes our emotions and therefore our mood in a non-desirable way. For example, people watch television to relax. Going through menus is an unwelcome break when one is in a relaxed atmosphere: it changes our mood from relaxation to frustration. There is a need for a technique that assumes the desired experienced mood and derives the experience interface including its front-end design, back-end design and its operation, taking into account the mood swings caused by the specific brain activity required for the interface of process and work flow. There is also a need for an interface that puts people in the right mood for certain activities or processes that are not yet optimally served today. Such applications, underserved from the experience point of view, are illustrated and grouped in six designs. There is a need for a system and technique that makes products or content, for example audio, video, graphic, advertising, website, brochure, etc. are pre-selected from one or more content sources and are presented with a higher degree of accuracy, in particular an individual taste or the desired mood on a certain platform and to ask for a specific type of transaction. There is a need for an e-reader black and white text representation emulator with which the user can display the figures in color or 3D by performing a simple, intuitive operation that keeps the user relaxed and does not require him to go through menus , or text or keywords or even changing platforms There is a need for a web-based system that allows more automated recurring purchases. Such a system is not only a more efficient and relaxed alternative to state-of-the-art web shopping, but also to traditional supermarket shopping. There is a need for an automatic securities trading system that takes into account buyers and sellers' moods and performs automated trading activities accordingly. There is a need for a trading system that supports the left hemisphere's task of risk management and at the same time blocks the right hemisphere's pursuit of profit. There is a need for a model that links a buyer's typical emotions and mood, related to a specific type of sale, to an appropriate sales strategy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The disclosure relates to a neuropsychological modeling technique and the resulting mathematical model for human emotions and moods applied in buyer, seller, user and psychology experience, more specifically applied in experience, interface, platform, process, and back end design of products, processes or services. Natural experiences interfaces are based on specific characteristics of the left and right consciousness, applied in the left hemisphere, right hemisphere or tandem interfaces. Based on the modeling technique or model, a natural user experience mood is chosen, which dictates the design of the user interface and the back-end of the product, process or service in question. The model or modeling technique therefore forms the basis of the design of the natural user experience, the user interface, the product process or workflow as well as the back-end. Such neuropsychological model technique or model or the natural user experience or its interface or its back-end process can be applied in various designs, including but not limited to: 1) An internet and / or media and / or TV experience on it system, using a specific right brain interface and a tandem interface on different hardware platforms 2) A tandem interface for reading and / or research and / or writing, 3) A tandem user interface for that allows automatic buying on the internet for repeat consumer purchases. 4) An automatic system for trading securities, 5) An automatic internet bank or investment fund and 6) a model for sales training, consultancy and software. Therefore, and more generally, there is a need for a neuropsychological modeling technique and model that links basic human emotions, moods, and cortical activity, interface design strategies including their back-end, front-end, and operational process of human experiences. Experiences are understood as moods that occur naturally and optimally in certain processes. Interfaces between these processes and the experiences in the human brain are optimally designed to support the natural and optimal experience at every stage of the process. So left, right and tandem interfaces are used, with specific cortical request to lure specific moods.

Neuropsychological Model: Mathematical Modeling Emotions Proposed herein are specific characteristics of parallel human thinking in the left and right cortex, including a proposal for the explanation of the underlying mechanism of neurotransmitter. Positive and negative human emotions are defined and the bivalent of emotions are represented under this definition. The proposed mathematical independence of positive and negative emotions is supported by their largely independent physiological constitution. This forms the basis for the mathematical classification of emotions and moods in a two-dimensional emotion space. Individual forms of consciousness are defined and an explanation of how the mood arises from consciousness is provided. The moods are well described in a logarithmic complex emotion plane, formed by two perpendicular dimensions, the expression of natural anxiety and desire components. Emotions are bivalent instead of bipolar. Based on the above definition of positive and negative emotions and considering their independence or mathematical squareness, emotions can be modeled in two perpendicular dimensions, rather than in a dimension where the positive and negative emotions would be negatively correlated. Therefore, positive and negative emotions can be represented as two independent or perpendicular basic vectors in mathematical emotion space, thus decomposing every emotion into its positive and negative emotions components, represented in a two-dimensional domain, where the emotions can be represented as vectors, coordinates or real and imaginary parts of complex numbers, as shown in Figure IC. Dissecting emotions into their natural anxiety and desire components Anxiety is defined, with capital 'F, not just as fear, but as the general negative elemental emotion. By analogy, Desire is a general positive valence elemental emotion. Although there is an alternative to naming it, it provides an intuitive understanding of more abstract mathematics. Representation of moods in this two-dimensional Anxiety - Desire domain causes mathematically dissolving every specific emotion in its natural components of Anxiety, intuitively understood as fear and desire, intuitively understood as desire. Such decomposition into basic emotions by projection on the perpendicular vector basis (Edl, Efi), where | Edl | = 1 and | Efi | = 1 is mathematically represented as: E = Ed + Ef = x * Edl + y * Efi In this comparison, E is a vector with size | E || = E and direction φ (see figure 3). Using complex annotation numbers, the desire part is the real part of the complex emotion z, fear is an imaginary part. z = x + i * y = d + i * f D and F are the Desire and Anxiety coordinates represented as (d, f) of a specific emotion. They are the result of projecting the emotion on the orthogonal basis of fear and desire and can be represented in the positive quadrant of the complex plane. Emotions and moods are well represented in the logarithmic complex emotion plane. The emotion and mood space can be represented as the positive quadrant of the complex plane, where (1.1) stands for the individuals average level of anxiety and desire. Using the logarithmic representation of mental states, this emotion space can be transformed into a mood space that covers the entire complex plane, where 0 is assigned to - oo, 1 to zero and + oo to + oo, because exp (- co ) = o, exp (0) = 1 and exp (+ oo) = + oo. Therefore, moods can be displayed in the complex logarithmic mood plane of Figure 1D. Representing Emotions In The Mood Disk The complex plane represents the emotional domain that can be mapped onto Mood Disk disk. To represent this complex logarithmic mood area in a more compact way, without using the notion of infinity, we represent moods on a unit disk, called the mood disk, as shown in Figure IE. To arrive at this Disk, the logarithmic complex tuning area was first mapped onto a Riemann sphere using the inverse stereoscopic projection, shown in Figure 1F. The points A and B are projected by the stereoscopic projection. With the same holographic projection, this complex plane is also projected on half a Riemann sphere with center S (oo), as shown in figure 6. A and S (A), but also as B and S (B) are projected on GS (A) and HS (B) respectively. Next, this half Riemann sphere is expected to be the unit disk as the bottom of the half Riemann sphere by projecting O, projecting GS (A) on AMD and HS (B) on BMD. The resulting unit disk projection ensures the natural display of moods on the mood disk, without affecting the intuitively less accessible notion of infinity. Representing emotions on the Mood Square. Finally, emotions and moods can be naturally, intuitively and mathematically easily represented in an emotion or mood square. The linear left brain consciousness has difficulty interpreting the non-Euclidean metric of the feeling disc. And confusion occurs easily if straight lines are represented non-linearly. In the mood disk straight lines are represented as circles, except for the rays of the sensory disk and through a certain point an infinite amount of parallel lines, represented as circles, can be drawn in the mood disk, meaning that the metric is non-Euclidean . Since the mood disc is analytically difficult to read due to the distortion caused by the stereographic projection, we can present them in a simpler or more straightforward way, more accessible to the left consciousness. We achieve this by representing the unit disk in the Chebyshev metric as a unit square, shown in Figure 1H. This emotion and mood unit Square is accessible to both the right and left brain consciousness and therefore the desired domain to represent emotions and in fact any dimensional phenomenon in the Riemann sphere as S (A) and S (BI. Locate Sell & Buy On The Mood Disk Referring to 5B, business-to-consumer sales figure is best done in the - π / 8—3 n / 8 area, while business-to-business sales can best be positioned inden / 8 + 3n / 8. Or, in words, sales and / or marketing will be most successful if they put the consumer in a relaxed mood and companies in a passionate mood - indeed, fear is usually greater when buying on behalf of a company than when buying purchase something as just a consumer. Given a certain level of desire, which is represented by the desire coordinate d, Vreest represented by the fear coordinate f, can be reduced to the level that the motivational power of m is maximum or close to -n / 4 for sale to consumers or + n / 4 for business-to-business sales. In order for a consumer to sell optimally instead of buying, one has to be localized to the - 3n / 4 atmosphere in the Mood Disk. Which means, it is usually in favor of a business / consumer to buy from a person who feels apathy towards the product that you want to buy from him. In all other cases, the selling price will often end up higher. For example, when the consumer / seller is afraid that he may still need the product or regret the sale, or when he absolutely loves the product (passionate mood), he is likely to be less willing to sell it. In order for an enterprise to sell optimally instead of buying, a localized location must be established on the + 3n / 4 atmosphere in the Mood Disk. For example, it is usually in favor of a buyer to buy from a B2B sales person who is scared (for example, about not hitting his goal). Also it is usually to the advantage of a consumer to buy a brand, which lowered their prices because they are concerned about the competition. Locate applications on the Mood Disk Applying the previous model specifically for interface design / development without losing priority to other application areas, allows accurate modeling of user psychology. Watching television => Relaxing mood Figure 6A conceptually shows the effect of an unwanted TV user interface experience represented as a path on the Mood Disk starting with a relaxed mood and ending in an angry mood. Television sales => Relaxed mood Television management => Passionate mood Reading and researching => Relaxed & passionate mood Trading securities => Panic & passionate mood Bank / investing => Worried / Panic mood Selling => Relaxed & passionate mood Locate platform sales on the Mood Disk It is possible that the mood is optimal for the nature of the sale at hand, different from the Mood Disk, usually with regard to the platform at hand. As explained earlier, business-to-consumer sales are best done in the - n / 8 - 3 n / 8 area (relaxed atmosphere), while business-to-business sales can best be positioned in the n / 8 + 3 n / 8 area (passionate mood). We also know that right hemisphere platforms such as television are usually located in the - π / 8 - 3 n / 8 area, while for example internet websites are usually located in the n / 8 + 3n / 8 area. In general, the nature of the sale has a stronger influence on the design of a purchasing platform / process than the type of platform. This means that, for example, a business-to-consumer website for books is optimally designed in such a way that the consumer is relaxed. Reading itself, on the other hand, is something that people normally do in a passionate mood. So when it comes to reading, the optimum purchasing experience (relaxed atmosphere) differs from the optimum product experience (passionate mood). Modeling fear and desire elements Modeling a user's fear and / or desire component to a specific product or content can be done by collecting conscious user feedback and / or by unknowingly measuring viewing and surfing behavior while watching TV or surfing the website . Reduction of the Anxiety component is preferably performed in a Left Brain Activity environment, such as with a text-based work environment and not, for example, while watching TV. Consequently, viewing and surfing behavior is well suited to model the D coordinate while the active text-based input is suitable for modeling the coordinate. The Television Recommender The foregoing concepts for modeling Desire and Anxiety vectors relative to their mapping on the Mood Disk can be performed with a unique neuropsychological modeling engine as described herein. For the sake of clarity and intelligibility, we describe the operation of such a motor after the example of a television experience system. However, the principles apply to a wide range of applications, namely all those who can take advantage of recommender functionality. The modeling engine described here, for example, serves as a mechanism whereby content objects can be arranged whereby a given, (viewer) his viewing / surfing behavior is measured unconsciously and / or conscious feedback from users. Once arranged, the specialized set of user interfaces described herein can be utilized for multidimensional browsing of the previously arranged content objects. Unique to this disclosure is the concept of a truly subjective channel. In contrast to the state of the art in which subject content is objectively classified according to the content provider source and defined according to the available viewing times. A channel in accordance with the disclosure comprises one or more groups of content objects specially selected based on a viewer's subjective preferences and mood and it is arranged in order from low to high emotional motivation for the viewer to select and select the content. see. In an exemplary system, a viewer or a group of viewers, such as a family, may have multiple personalized channels containing content programs that are autonomously merged and screened according to their personal interests, using the modeling system described herein and which can be viewed using the user interface application controls that are associated with the viewer system 32 described herein. Or they are made by mixing the individual channels. Network Application of Recommender Engine for the viewing experience Figure 7 illustrates conceptually a network environment 38 in which the neuropsychological modeling engine described herein can be executed. Network environment 38 includes one or more private networks 31 and a public wide area network (WAN) 30 such as the internet. Private networks 31 can be implemented with all known network technologies such as a cable package network from a cable service provider or a packet-switched local area network (LAN) or wireless network. Public network 30 may contain a coherent collection of other networks using all currently known network technology including both wireless and optical etc. Functionally linked to each of the networks 31 and 30, a content provider 34 is a viewer system 32 and a model system 35 that contains the neuropsychological modeling engine described herein. Also connected to the network 30 are additional content providers 36 and 37, as well as an additional viewer system 33. The viewer systems 32 and 33 can be implemented as described with reference to Figure 11. Modeling system Figure 8 illustrates a theoretical block diagram of modeling system 35 that includes the neuropsychological modeling engine 41. In particular, system 35 described in phantom consists of a pair of gateways 44 and 45 connecting system 35 to networks 30 and 31, respectively. In an exemplary embodiment, system 35 further comprises a server platform 40 and one or more databases 46-48. Server 40, which can be executed with a single server or multiple servers, carries out neuropsychological modeling engine 41 and ranking application 42 and behavioral modeller 49, all of which communicate with each other but also with databases 46-48 and other entities that via the network interface 43 that connects server 40 to databases 46-48, as well as networks 30 and 31. Database 46 can be used to store documents or other data structures that represent the neuropsychological model of one or more viewers connected to the viewer system 32 as well as to store other viewer systems. Database 47 can be used to store content objects, e.g. the files of the various multimedia content, available for viewing the viewer's content 32. Database 47 can also store meta data in connection with the respective content files. Figure IOC theoretically illustrates an example of a content object meta data file 75. Database 48 can be used to store one or more channels 90A-C, which are the rankings or commands of multiple content objects associated with channel model (s), 72 and viewer model 70. Note that although each of databases 46-48 are represented as a single database, it is contemplated that one of them can be executed with a number of databases in different configurations, including distributed, redundant and peer-to-peer continuous migration of configurations . Alternatively, the data from one or more of the databases 46 to 48 can be combined into a single database. For example, can the arrangement of the content associated with a specific viewer channel model be stored together with the data defining the viewer model? In addition, each of the databases 46-48 may contain their own database server for interfacing with the server 40 or they may share a database server. Figure 9A theoretically illustrates the elements of an embodiment of modeling system 35 needed to derive the relationship between the meta data linked to a content object and an individual viewer model relative to the arrangement of the content object in relation to the specific channel model. Specifically, each object has content stored in the database 47 with a file 75 attached to it, which has various data parameters for the content of the file, such as the format, duration, title, genre, actor, producer year of the first release, etc. contains. Any number of different data structure formats can be used for this particular structure. Such content file files can also be stored in the database 47. Also, each individual (or group of viewers, e.g., a family) associated with viewer system 32 has one associated with it. model 70, which contains data describing the behavioral model consisting of viewers meta data such as. includes gender, age, occupation, product / service description level etc. and idealized preferences for the viewer (or groups of viewers) in terms of genre, actors, particular series, area of interest, past selection history, viewing times, duration or other parameters. Figure 10a illustrates an exemplary data structure that can be used to execute the behavior model 70 for a specific viewer (or groups of viewers). As previously noted, such viewer meta data files can be stored in the database 46. To help with the effectiveness of their services search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc., ontologies of reality are created. Ontologies are used in artificial intelligence, the Semantic Web, systems engineering, software engineering, biomedical computer science, library science, business bookmarking, and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation about the world or part of it. In essence, such search engines create an objective index of the content of that reality. Such indexed content is stored in one or more databases as shown in Figure 9A by database-60. In an exemplary body, database 60 and the indexed content may or may not be part of modeling the system 35, but may therefore be accessible through a public or private network. Numbers 9D-F illustrate the process flow between the components of modeling the system 35 into a viewer model and channel model update, retrieve new information and determine whether this content is suitable for ranking according to the system model of the viewer's emotional motivation. Referring to Figures 9E-F, viewing behavior including events such as requesting a specific program, completion of viewing a content object, saving, or purchasing content, managing a channel, causing viewer system 32 for sending event data packet (s) the behavior model 49 of modeling the system 35 as illustrated by arrow A of figure 9A and decision-making blocks 61 of figure 9E. After receiving such event data, behavior model 49, it modifies the viewer model 70 in relation to the specific viewer, as illustrated by process blocks 62A and, if necessary, channel model (s) 72, as evidenced by process blocks 62B. Behavior model 49 then retrieves the model from database 46 for the specific viewer and the meta ata file 72A that defines the channel. In addition, behavioral model 49 extracts from database 47 the file describing the content. Thereafter, model 49 compares the received event data with file 75 of the content object and the current 70 and changes the channel model (s) 72 properly (indicated by the round arrow in model 49), as illustrated by process blocks 62A and 62B of 9E. In each case 70 is changed and possibly the channel can also be changed, as would be in case of channel management and search term change. At certain events, e.g. periodically (a timer event), viewer event, event content (e.g., new VOD content), the modeling engine 41 is performed. The modeling engine 41 requests from database 60 an indexed content material that may be of interest as illustrated by arrow D of Figure 9D and blocks the process 63 of Figure 9F. In this case, modeling engine 41 can be programmed to interact with the query format of a number of different sources of indexed content or content libraries. As a first step, modeling engine 41 works based on content filtering based on and the channel model. Note that both the viewer model and the channel model are used in the illustrative embodiments to specify requests and questions. Referring to Figure 9E, queries can be based on a combination of ontology components (with strong coefficient values in model) and filter criteria from the channel Based on the coefficient corresponding to each selected component available in the model (as calculated by process block 62A) the Mood Disk disk Fear D coordinate f, and Desire D coordinate for this content object are calculated. In embodiments, the modification of the viewer model 70 can be performed with the following algorithms. Each event is mapped on the Mood Disk disk 20 according to a prescribed rule, e.g., purchase of a content object results in a predetermined Ψ and m- value (or an equivalent Fear D coordinate f and Desire D coordinate). In a first step in the location on the Mood Disk disk 20 of the content is described, object is determined for a particular user. It is assumed that for the viewer in question the content object is probably somewhere in the demarcated area in Figure 6D. Neuropsychological model engine 41 examines the metadata file for the content object, and in combination with metadata from the viewer's meta data file and / or channel model, calculates where on the mathematical model of human emotion, i.e. the Mood Disk disk, previously described With reference to Figures 1-6, the viewer mood and motivational power are relative to that specific content object. Based on the coefficient corresponding to each selected component available in the viewer model (as calculated by process block 62A), the Mood Disk Fear coordinate f, and Desire coordinate d for this content object are calculated ... For each channel that is associated with the viewer model ranking application 42, it assesses whether the content object meets the filter criteria for the channel. In a next step, the similarity of the mood each selected the contents of object vector to the Mood Disk vector associated with this channel calculated using the ""cosine similarity measure"". This measure allows the application to rank the contents of objects selected for this channel relatively based on their similarity to the channel vector's mood. In an optional second step, a ""collaborative filtering"" post-processing step to update the rank of the content of objects in the selection of the engine 41 for this channel and viewer. However, unlike traditional ""collaborative filtering"" implementations the ""similarity"" of viewers is calculated not only based on the desired content of objects and a correspondence in the preferred language of the content of object metadata, but also the correspondence in the Mood Disk stored in the viewer's model. Viewer system Figure 11A conceptually illustrates a viewer interface system 32 relative to public network 30, content provider sources 34 and 36, and model system 35 in accordance with the disclosure. Also illustrated in Figure 11A is the remote control 88 related to display 80. The viewer system 32 includes a first or right brain user interface to display 80, primarily used for viewing video content that can be used in the illustrative embodiment. equipped with a television screen 80 and a corresponding remote control 88. Display 80 can be performed with a ""connected TV"" or other devices that connect the TV to the networks of 30 or 31, such as a connected Blu-ray player or a game console. connected, for example a device capable of direct connection to the internet, for example the network 30, as well as a cable packet network or satellite network, for example the network 31. Viewer system 32 further comprises a second or left brain user interface 84 which a content presents surf interface and purchase interface and can be performed on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or smart phone, tab let computer or even laptop computer. This second user interface mainly uses and / or stimulates the activity in the left hemisphere of the human brain, and also, to a limited extent, the right hemisphere of the human brain. A viewer will typically use the second user interface from 84 through activities such as storage, purchasing, changing the order of, specifying an if / dislike for a particular content object within the rankings of a channel 90 from to feed. Viewer system 32 further optionally includes third and fourth user interfaces 86 and 87, respectively, capable of presenting both the textual based interfaces for content browsing and purchasing, as well as visual content and can be implemented with a traditional personal computer such as a desktop or laptop, but also other systems. Figure 11B illustrates the algorithmic processes performed by a redirect application 85. The first, after activation, request 85 waits for remote commands sent from the remote control 88. Application 85 examines the data of a received signal, usually the field in a header file or the data stream identifying a command to determine whether the received signal associated with a command becomes one of the signals to be diverted, such as the Up, Down, Left, and Right cursor navigation signals from the remote control 88. If so, depending on the cursor navigation command, the application application 85 sends to the model system 35 the data needed to view the new content object. This data can be implemented in a number of different techniques, such as with a memory off-set at a time or recently viewed content objects, with a sequence number representing the next content object within the channel data structure 95, or with a soluble link retrieved from the file with metadata content linked to the currently displayed object, as stored locally within the viewer system. Figure 11C illustrates the algorithmic processes being performed by the server application 51 of modeling the system 35 after receiving the handle or reference data from redirection application 85 identifying the following content object to be displayed. Depending on the nature of the handle or reference data, server application 51 unloads all addresses, links or references to the next content object to be displayed and then extracts the meta data file associated with such a content object, usually from the database 47. Then the actual data related to the content object retrieved from database 47 and to the first user interface 80 of the viewer system 35 via either public network 30 or private network 31, depending on the precise implementation of the system. Simultaneously with the start of content streamed to viewer system 32, 49 server, the application can start with a timer to determine the last time until the streaming is terminated, usually when the next content object to be viewed is selected. After receiving a command to terminate the streaming server, application 51 sends a value that elapsed time of the previously assessed content object together with the meta data of the content object behavior model module 49 for updating behavior change of the viewer model. Other available commands can similarly cause streaming of content to end and the viewer behavior model to be updated with the elapsed time, including but not limited to, channel up / down, back button (results when starting another content object), pause, fast-forward, rewind (within the content object), etc. You can, instead of maintaining an elapsed time value, server application 51 can examine the time code embedded within the header of the last streamed data packet to determine roughly how much of the content object was viewed by the viewer before the streaming was terminated. Data that elapsed time based on this value can then be sent in the same way to behavior model module 49. Thereafter, a similar process takes place for identifying, retrieving, and streaming the next content object to be viewed. The process of using the cursor navigation buttons to perform multidimensional browsing of content objects within a certain viewer channel is illustrated with reference to 12A-B Figure. Referring to 12A, a multidimensional channel, Figure 90 has been conceptually demonstrated to illustrate the concept of multidimensional browsing of content along the desire and time vectors 92 and 94, respectively, using traditional cursor navigation buttons 91, 93, 95, and 97. In particular, channel 90 associated with a specific subject / viewer comprises a first plurality of content objects C1, C2t, C3t, C4T, C5t, ... Cnt along a first dimension 92 that were arranged in order decreasing desires usually, from high to lowest. In an illustrative embodiment, viewer activation of the Up cursor control 91 initiates viewing of the next content object in dimension 92 of channel 90 for which the subject / viewer will require increased motivation to view or purchase the content thereof . Also, viewer activation of the Down cursor control 97 initiates viewing of the next content object in dimension 92 of channel 90 where the subject / viewer will require a reduced motivation to view or purchase the content. One or more of the first plurality of content objects Clt - Cnt are connected by links or references, a second plurality of content objects that are related by chronological order along a second dimension 94 and which share one or more common meta data parameters. For example, as illustrated, content object C4T has related a plurality of content objects C4T-1, C4T-2, C4T-3, C4T-4, ... C4T-n chronologically in a first direction, for example, sequentially in order of increasing age in the left direction. Content object C4T also has a multitude of content objects C4T +1, C4T +2, C4T +3, C4T +4, ... C4T + p chronologically in a second direction, opposite the first direction, for example, in order of descending age in the direction to the right. In an illustrative embodiment, activation by the viewer of the left cursor control 93 initiates viewing of the next object in the content to the left direction of the dimension 94 of channel 90 in which the subject / viewer will require at least the same motivation to view or buy the content. Also viewer activation of the right cursor control 95 initiates viewing of the next content object in dimension 94 of channel 90 for which the subject / viewer may also have at least the same or different motivational desire to view or purchase the content. Distributed Upload System The aforementioned systems can be used in combination with the distributed upload system described below. Referring specifically to Figures 13A-B, selected elements of the network environment 38, as illustrated in Figures 7, 8 and 11A, are conceptually represented. In particular, Figure 13A illustrates a plurality of systems viewer 32a-n operatively linked to both a content source 36 and a model system 35. Viewer systems 32a-n can be implemented as previously described with the additional modifications as described below. The modeling system 35 can also be carried out as previously described. Content source 36 can be executed as previously described with reference to the source 60 of Figure 9A, which contains indexed content material, or one of the content providers 34 or 37 of Figure 7, or, each of Cable TV service provider may consist of via the cable package network, satellite TV provider via the satellite network, or broadcast live via internet (internet television). Figure 13b illustrates an alternative conceptual network configuration, similar to Figure 13A, except that content file source 30 communicates with the modeling system 35, in addition to or in place of the viewer systems 32a-n. Figure 14 illustrates conceptually selected elements of the display system 32 interface to public network 30, content provider source 36, and modeling system 35 in accordance with the disclosure. The viewer system 32 comprises a first or right brain user interface screen 80, which is mainly used for viewing video content that can be implemented in the illustrative embodiment with television screen 80 and an associated remote control 88. Display 80 can be performed with a ""connected TV"" or other devices that connect the TV to the networks 30, such as a connected Blu-ray player or a game console is connected, for example a device capable of direct connection to the internet, such as the network 30, as well as a cable packet network or satellite network, for example the network 31. Viewer system 32 further comprises a second or left brain user interface 84 that presents a content surf interface and the purchase of interface and can be performed on a Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA) or smart phone, tablet computer or even laptop computer. In the embodiment for clarification, television screen 80 further comprises a request process 100 for interface with content provider source 36 and modeling of the system 35. In particular, the application comprises 100 includes modeling of interface process 102 and crawler process 104. Modeling of system interface process 102 makes viewer system 32 through source 36 and modeling system 35 communicate in a manner described below with reference to Figures 13A-B. Crawler process 104 cooperates with process 102 and content source36, and, if applicable, a scheduling application or electronic program guide function 106 related to content source 36 in a manner described below. Crawler process 104 interacts with content source 36 and model system 35, via process 102, in the following manner. Crawler continuously processes 104 searches scheduling function 106 in relation to content source 36 to determine which content programs are currently accessible for download streaming from content source 36 through to viewer system 32. The determination of such accessibility will usually be determined by registering the viewer with the content source provider. Every time process 104 identifies content that the viewer has legally authorized access, crawler process 104 initiates download streaming of content to display 80 and buffers a fractional percentage of content in memory associated with display 80 further along with selected metadata linked to content, including the data identifying the content, and one or more temporary or sequential identifiers or markers identifying the specific portion of the content contained within the buffer, as illustrated by arrow A of Figure 13A. Figure 13C shows a conceptual algorithmic processes to capture and upload content object fractions y-viewer system 32. Crawler process 104 then sends to process 102, one or more packets of data regarding the buffe content together with the information identifying the content. Or, alternatively, it offers the addresses in memory where this information is stored and accessible by both processes. Process 102 adds to this information, a data structure 120 as illustrated in Figure 15 and transmits or streams such information to the model system as illustrated by arrow B of Figure 13A. In one embodiment, process 102 may request composition server 110 from the viewer model or determine whether a full copy of the content object already resides in the aggregation server database 112 or database 47. If so, process 102 will only send the data structure 120 to the aggregation server 110 to eliminate unnecessary network bandwidth usage. If aggregation server 110 requires a specific segment of the content object, the process 102 will specify the specific segment (s), recognizable by temporary or sequential identifiers process. Process 102 will process this information to crawler 104 for forwarding and acquiring the content from / to the source 36. Referring to Figure 15, in one embodiment, data structure 120 may consist of the identification data of a portion of a content object 122, temporary or sequential identifiers are associated with the content object 124, 126, and authorization indicia to identify a viewer process. Thereby, data structure 120 may further consist of possibly the data 128 identifying a user-defined channel in connection with the viewer process and identification data of an encryption key 129 for decoding the content object. The functionality repeated by crawler processes 104, while the continuous display device 80 is further functionally connected to content source 36, for all content processed by the viewer. User interface for Presentation and surfing of multiple content objects According to one aspect of the disclosure, a system and technique for presenting multiple, simultaneous content object data relies on a user interface that is provided in a way that the viewer surfs in multiple dimensions. A primary content stream, representative of the selected content object in a dimension of a viewer channel, is presented in a substantial part of the right brain user interface screen area while a plurality of secondary content object data streams, representing selectable content objects on which the viewer can navigate, are presented in smaller or thumbnail format in the balance of the user interface display area. The multiple secondary content streams presented on the user interface each represent selectable content objects with a queue relationship to the selected primary content object data stream. Such a queue relationship can exist between and between different content object streams in the same dimension of a viewer channel or between separately selectable parts of a single object content stream or program, or between different content objects in these dimensions of a viewer channel, e.g. chronologically arranged episodes from the same program. The process of using the cursor navigation buttons to multidimensionally browse content objects within a particular viewer channel is described herein with reference to Figures 12A-B. Figure 12A conceptually illustrates a multidimensional channel 90, which multidimensionally surfing the content along desire and time vectors 92 and 94, respectively, using traditional cursor navigation buttons. Fig. 12B conceptually illustrates the implementation of channel 90 associated with a specific subject / viewer in the database 48. Channel 90 may consist of a plurality of channels 90A-C stored in the database 48 of model system 35. The process by which navigation controls can be used to surf multidimensionally and view the content object streams displayed on viewer system 32 within a particular viewer channel 90 is described with reference to Figs. 16-22 referring to Fig. 16, database 48 of the model system cooperates with content database 47 or other content sources 34, 36 to ensure that a data stream containing the content object (s) within viewer channel 90 is buffered in memory associated with viewer system 32 for rendering and viewing on the Viewer- interface 32 consists of the right brain user interface screen 80, which is mainly used for viewing video content and an associated remote control 88. Figure 16 illustrates conceptually of the relationship between the components of the screen 80 (in phantom), including User Interface (UI) display area 120, 115 graphic engine, a primary stream buffer 116 and multiple secondary stream buffers 118 A-n related to the content objects, consisting of a viewer channel. Graphic engine 115 is typically part of the display 80 and controls the streaming, decoding, windowing, and display of multiple data streams based on the content data and command / format data contained in the data packets associated with each stream. Buffers 116 and 118 can be implemented as segmented sections of the local memory associated with graphic engine 115, or else they can be separately and remotely stored from screen 80. Display 80 and viewer system 32 are connected via the network 30, represented as a cloud in Figure 16, the model system 35 and the source of the content object data streams, usually one of the database 34, 36, 37 or 47. A multitasking / multithreading control system can be used in the viewer system 32 for streaming, buffering and monitor display of content object data stream. Specifically, each stream may be associated with different threads of execution, including a thread for buffering and one or more threads for formatting and displaying content object data on the display of the display 80. As illustrated in Figure 16, the location where content stream object has a buffer 116 attached to it and one or more threads, collectively referred to as 117. The plurality of secondary content object streams each have a perspective buffer 118 An and associated sets of one or more threads, collectively referred to as 119a -n, as illustrated. In the described embodiment primary content object data stream 128 is streamed from the original source through the respective buffer while the secondary content object data streams 121 to 126 can optionally loop through part of their respective content, usually the first few minutes or another amount stored in each of the respective buffers. In this way, the presentation of visual information to the viewer on the UI display 120 is more informative, particularly regarding secondary content object data streams 121 to 126, efficient use of resources within the processor graphic engine 115 and network bandwidth in and from viewer system 32. Each content object with data streamed up to and including screen 80 has associated therewith a data structure 111, as illustrated in Figure 17, which includes information regarding the visible parameters of the content object, including but not limited to layout parameters, status, navigation Options and Property Rights Data. In addition to the metadata concerning the content object, such as the object identifier, the format identifier, links to other content objects within the viewer channel, the memory address where the data consists of the saved object and the size of the content object, data structure 111 also exists from data fields indicating the license status of the object, whether or not free (prepaid), pay-per-view, or pay for one-time use, view elapsed time, whether the content object was compiled by the model system 35, the name and the photo of the person who recommended the content object, and other data necessary for the representation of the different graphic elements and instructions around the representation of the content object, as explained in more detail in figures 18 - 22. Virtual channels Referring to Figure 23, a plurality of virtual channels 160-230 are conceptually illustrated with respect to viewer systems 32a-b and a model as described herein, and other sources of content. Virtual channels 160-230 make it possible to have objects from left-brain half content content being implemented in a right-brain half user interface in accordance with the objectives of the disclosure. Virtual channels 160 to 230 can be logically controlled similar to channels 90A-C of Figure 12B and can contain content objects from a single source or multiple sources, as described in more detail in numbers 24-31. Referring to Figure 24, a first type of virtual channel, Recommendation Channel 160, may include posting recommendations from friends and / or family or other individuals from other sources, such as Twitter, Facebook, Picasa, Vimeo, groups within Facebook, Linkedln, or a other website or network mechanisms 162a-n to model for display via the viewer system 32 32. Referring to Figure 25, a second type of virtual channel, a Program Director Channel 170 can explicitly (left brain) take control of the experience of viewing session and active control of the content of that channel. Director Channel 170 can be useful for viewers who love film, viewers who want to schedule a specific viewing session, professionals who want to schedule a specific presentation sequence, such as a demo for a client. Explicit Kiiker feedback In addition to the implicit feedback detectable by viewer's selections and viewing behavior, the described system also offers the possibility of giving explicit feedback to the recommendation system in a manner that requires little left brain activity. In particular, traditional navigation controls from the display remote controls, for example specifically colored coded controls, can be used to give explicit feedback to the recommendation system in a manner that requires little left brain activity. Selection of different color-coded keys can be used to involve any of a negative or positive valence emotion in the cases of a certain periodically broadcast content (e.g., a series) and / or its metadata. In addition, the selection of another color-coded check can be used to share socially on the current content of the applicable social networks or to give a reward to the author (s) of the content currently being viewed or the recommender of that content. Specifically, as part of the disclosed system and technique for relaxed TV viewing, the command 240-246 controls a typical remote control 88 or be another device that receives new functions as illustrated in Figure 32. As illustrated in Figure 32, the selection of a first colored control panels 240, e.g., of a red button, can be used to involve negative valence emotion in the cases of a particular periodic broadcast content (e.g., of a series) and / or its metadata. Selection of a second colored control 242, for example of a blue button, can be used to associate positive valence emotion with the cases of a certain periodically broadcast content (for example of a series) and / or its metadata. Selection of a third colored control 244, for example of a yellow button, can share socially to the current viewed content of the applicable social networks. Selection of fourth colored check 246, for example of a green button, can convey gratitude to the author (s) of the content currently being viewed or to the recommender of that content. It will be apparent to those reasonably skilled in the art of the variations of the system described above and the technique used. For example, there is no need to provide a specific one to a correspondence between checks and the type of explicit feedback from the viewer on the recommendation system. Although the various embodiments of the system and techniques described herein with reference to the content objects with video data, the system described, in particular the tandem user interface and the neuropsychological models engine can also be used with other forms of content, including audio, art, advertising, literature, physical objects, etc. with only minor adjustments to the described system and techniques as would be understood by those reasonably skilled in the relevant art, given the disclosures as described herein. It will be apparent to those who are reasonably skilled in the art that changes to the systems and processes described herein may occur without departing from the true spirit and purport of disclosure. For example, any two elements that are directly connected or via a network can use either a push or a pull technique in addition to a specific communication protocol or technique described herein. Furthermore, despite the network implementation described, any existing or future network or communication infrastructure technologies can be used, including any combination of public and private networks. In addition, although specific algorithmic flow charts or data structures have been illustrated, these are merely exemplary purposes, other processes that obtain the same functions or use different data structures or formats are considered within the scope of the terms described herein. As such, the exemplary embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to be limited.

BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION We have previously described, in W02009/093056, a mobile phone handset incorporating one or more acoustic sensors to pick up the unique acoustic signature of an input area struck by the user. We now describe details of some particularly preferred approaches which have been tested and found to work effectively. Other background prior art can be found in patents assigned to Sensitive Object, in particular US7,511,711 and US7,345,677. Broadly speaking an aspect of the problem we address is to make acoustical measurements from one or more microphones embedded in an electronic device such as a mobile phone or laptop computer or a microphone to make the device touch sensitive. The acoustic signal from a user, say, tapping on the device using, for example, a stylus, pen tip, finger nail, or finger, is detected and analysed (either in the device or remotely) in order to determine where the device has been tapped. The resolution of this determination is variable - for example the device may be provided with a grid of touch sensitive regions akin to a keyboard, or a simple differentiation may be made between, say, two regions such as one or other half of the device. In still other approaches the determination may simply be as to whether the device has been tapped in a particular region; or high resolution or quasi-continuous determination of a tap location may be made. In a typical application an icon may be displayed on the screen of a mobile phone in a touch-sensitive region, and user-tapping of the icon may then be employed, for example to navigate a menu. However it will be appreciated that many applications of the technology are possible. Although the concept is simple, the implementation can be difficult. However we have previously described, in our co-pending UK patent application GB1014309.7 filed on 27 August 2010, algorithms which can accurately and repeatedly identify the region of a device on which a user has tapped. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is defined in claim 1. There is therefore described a method of detecting a tap on an object having at least one acoustic/vibration sensor, the method comprising: capturing tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap on said object captured by said sensor; processing said captured tap data by applying a tap detection procedure to generate time series tap metric data comprising data providing a detection metric of a potential said tap at a succession of times - in particular to generate time series probability data comprising data identifying the probability of a potential said tap at a succession of times; determining a classifier to classify said detection metrics or probabilities of potential said taps into one or more detected taps; and applying said classifier to said tap metric/probability data to detect said tap on said object; wherein said determining of said classifier comprises identifying a region of background noise in said captured tap data; and determining said classifier from data in said region of background noise. In embodiments the above described system enables improvements in making small, simple electronic devices touch-sensitive using an in-built microphone (or other acoustic/vibration sensor, for example an accelerometer). In embodiments the tap metric data comprises tap probability data, for example determined from a Bayesian detector as described above, but in other approaches different tap detection metrics may be employed. In embodiments identifying the region of background noise comprises identifying potential taps for which the probability is greater than a threshold value and then defining the region of background noise to exclude time windows around each of these potential taps. Additionally or alternatively background noise may be identified using data from a second sensor to identify regions with less than a threshold level of tap activity. The second sensor may be another acoustic sensor or an accelerometer or gyroscopic sensor, or two such second sensors may be present (if two are present then identification of a tap to remove from the background may require signals from both these sensors). In embodiments the classifier may be determined by generating synthetic tap data comprising from the background noise and stored (genuine) tap data, then applying the tap detection procedure to this and afterwards setting the classifier to distinguish the synthesised genuine tap events, for example by setting a threshold probability value. Optionally different classifiers/thresholds may be employed for different tap locations in a system configured to distinguish between different tap locations. There is also described a method of determining an adaptive threshold for acoustic tap detection using the above described technique. There is also described an electronic device, such as a mobile phone, comprising a processor, working memory, program memory, and a communications interface, the program memory storing processor control code to implement a method as described above. There is also described a processor control code for the above described electronic devices, and to implement the above-described systems and methods, for example on a general purpose computer system or on a digital signal processor (DSP). The code is provided on a carrier such as a disk, CD- or DVD-ROM, programmed memory such as non-volatile memory (e.g. Flash) or read-only memory (Firmware). Code (and/or data) to implement embodiments of the invention may comprise source, object or executable code in a conventional programming language (interpreted or compiled) such as C, or assembly code. As the skilled person will appreciate such code and/or data may be distributed between a plurality of coupled components in communication with one another. Tap sensing We have previously described a method of detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the method comprising: storing a set of labelled training data, said labelled training data comprising digitised waveform data of waveforms captured from said sensor for taps at a plurality of different locations on said object in combination with location data indicating for each said waveform the location of the tap; processing said labelled training data to determine, for each of a plurality of tap-sensing regions of said object, mean value data and covariance data for at least two said waveforms captured from taps in the said region, said mean value data defining a mean of said at least two waveforms and said covariance data defining covariance of said at least two waveforms; capturing tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap at an unknown location captured by said sensor; and determining a tapped region of said object from said tap data and from said mean value data and said covariance data from said plurality of regions. In embodiments the labelled training data comprises location data and (digitised) time domain analogue waveforms captured for a plurality of taps at each position of a grid of touch sensitive regions, preferably using a variety of different tapping styles/instruments and the like. The waveforms for each grid region are time-aligned and then, for the set of time-aligned waveforms, mean and covariance functions are calculated. The mean comprises time series data, in effect an average waveform (and thus is a vector; the covariance comprises a matrix, in effect expressing the variability of the tap waveforms. Each touch sensitive region has a pair of these functions, that is in embodiments a mean value vector and a covariance matrix. The skilled person will recognise that a matched filter classifier might only use the mean, but embodiments of the techniques we describe improve upon this by using the variability/covariance data, in some preferred embodiments applying principle component analysis techniques as described later. Thus embodiments of the techniques we describe achieve improved performance by improved modelling of the random variabilities mentioned in the introduction above. It will be recognised that the resolution of the location data/tap sensing regions may be selected according to the application and they range from very low resolution, for example just one of two regions, to very high or quasi-continuous resolution. The mean and covariance data enable the calculation of the probability of a captured set of tap data (y) given a tap at a particular region j and with a particular start time/sample n0, p(y | y,zi0). In embodiments a formula for this probability p is based upon an assumption that the probability of tap location and time is Gaussian, and background noise is assumed (in the later formulae x denotes a clean tap signal without background noise). However, this Gaussian assumption is not necessary, and, further, a probability calculated with a Gaussian assumption seems to be reasonably accurate even though the underlying statistics may not be Gaussian. The probabilities p(y | y,n0) may be calculated for all the tap-sensing regions j and for all the potential tap start positions n0, thus providing a matrix of probabilities and the most likely (y,n0) may be selected by identifying the largest probability (an argmax approach). Alternatively a Bayesian approach may be employed, multiplying each probability by the prior probability of a tap at region j, time n0, p(j,n0') As described in more detail later, if all tap positions are equally likely, the prior probability of a tap at region j is 1/ J , where J is the total number of tap-sensing regions; similarly assuming each tap time is equally likely, this introduces a factor of 1/2V, where N is the total number of possible tap times. Preferably the probability of no tap (1-rz) is also included, where a is a non-critical tuneable parameter. With either the Bayesian or argmax approach the probabilities calculated may comprise a ratio of the probability of a tap to the probability of no tap (in the later mathematics labelled as a j = 0 case), in which case a ratio of > unity indicates that it is more likely than not that there has been a tap. In practice to reduce the risk of false positives a threshold of > unity for this ratio of probabilities may be employed. In some preferred embodiments a calculated probability p(y | y',zi0) takes account of (is dependent on) a determined level of background noise (cr2). The background noise may be determined from the captured tap data, for example by taking an average value of the data (assuming the tap does not add much energy) or by a more sophisticated technique. An example procedure then performs a calculation over two loops, one running over possible tap positions /, a second running over tap start time n0 in the captured tap data y, for each j, n0 calculating the probability of the captured data, more preferably the ratio of this to the no-tap null hypothesis, the tap region j defining which set of mean value data and covariance data to use in the probability calculation. In an electronic device the mean value data and covariance data for each of the tap-sensing regions may be stored in non-volatile memory, for example at manufacture or downloaded to the device later. In some embodiments the loop runs over all the possible tap times (zi0), but preferably, to reduce the amount of computation, the calculation is performed over only a sub-set of the possible tap times (n0’s) for example by calculating the energy in the captured signal and discarding the low energy portions of the signal and restricting the probability calculations to higher than average portions of the captured signal, where a tap is most likely. By setting an appropriate energy threshold a relatively restricted range of potential tap (start) times may be employed. The probability determination may be performed in software, hardware, or a combination of the two. In particular, in some preferred implementations of the probability calculation described later using basis functions the probability calculation involves a step which is effectively implementation of an FIR (finite impulse response) filter which may, for example, be efficiently implemented in hardware. In some preferred implementations of the method, a multi-component model of the tap waveforms for each region captured during the training procedure is employed. Thus the captured tap data at y is modelled as a sum of basis functions t with amplitudes determined by a corresponding set of unknown parameters Θ, together with background noise. This is motivated by the observation that tapping repeatedly at the same position results in different waveforms because there is a significant amount of unavoidable random variation in, for example, how the object/device is held, precisely how the tap takes place, and also, surprisingly, based on environmental parameters such as temperature. Thus the idea is to model the random variation using a relatively small number of underlying components, which enables modelling of the wave shape as well as the amplitude of the tap response. This is not as simple as just considering the object to be “ringing” with different frequency components when tapped - instead the idea is to approximate the covariance of the waveforms arising when repeatedly tapping the same region j by a set of underlying components. By employing a relatively small number of components the covariance is effectively denoised so that the determined probabilities are more robust. In general the components used to model sets of waveforms from different tap regions j are different (although in embodiments there may be some components in common - see later). In practice a relatively small total number of components (/) has been found to be adequate, in embodiments <10, for example 4 or 5. When modelling the covariance of the waveforms from a particular tap region it is convenient to assume a Gaussian distribution with a zero mean (a zero mean because the mean value data has already been subtracted off). The covariance data for the waveforms is typically a matrix (with one axis as time/sample), and this can be decomposed into a set of basis functions by any one of a range of techniques with which the skilled person will be familiar including, but not limited to, singular value decomposition, principal component analysis (an orthogonal decomposition), independent component analysis, non-negative matrix factorisation, latent variable analysis, and so forth. Thus in one approach the covariance matrix C is decomposed into eigenvalues/eigenvectors and the eigenvectors with eigenvalues below a threshold disregarded. (The threshold may be set, for example by examining the relative fall-off of the eigenvalues for the data set). Then the eigenvalues give the variances of the weighting components Θ of the basis functions, and the eigenvectors provide the set of basis functions t for a particular tap-sensitive region j. When the probabilities p(y | j,n0) are calculated these are calculated using covariance data for a region defined by the aforementioned eigenvalues and eigenvectors, that is the set of basis functions t for a region j and the corresponding variances of the weightings Θ. In such an approach typically the sets of basis functions t for each region are stored in non-volatile memory on the electronic device performing the tap location. The determination of the sets of basis functions, and the expression of the covariance data in terms of these, may be performed during the training phase. Thus the variance of the weights of the basis functions in the model are used rather than the “raw” covariance of the wave forms (the raw covariance data may be discarded once the basis function components for each region have been determined). Thus it will be recognised that the variance of the wave forms when tapping a particular region is expressed, in embodiments, in terms of the variance of components of a decomposition of (the covariance of) these waveforms. Once the probabilities p(y | y',zi0) have been determined they may be processed in a number of ways, as previously described. Alternatively, however, in embodiments of this multicomponent approach it is not necessary to determine the probabilities p(y I J>0) 'n order to determine the tapped region - instead determination of a tapped region may employ the estimated weights of the basis functions for the tapped regions. Thus, more particularly, a set of basis weightings θ may be determined for each candidate tapped region (and optionally tap time) and input into a classifier such as a neural network, support vector machine or the like. This is because the basis function weightings θ can be treated as features extracted from the data. As previously mentioned, although in embodiments the basis functions are different for different tap positions, some or all of the basis functions may be common to one or more of the tap-sensitive regions. To achieve this there may be initially a decomposition across a plurality of different tap-sensitive regions, performing a principal component analysis (or similar) on all the data, thus selecting components representing taps over the plurality of touch-sensitive regions. Then, because basis functions for the individual regions are also needed, a second decomposition may be performed region-by-region. Optionally embodiments of the method may employ training of different parameter sets (including basis functions) for different temperatures. Then an internal temperature sensor of the phone (or other electronic device) may be used to switch between different models (parameter sets). Additionally or alternatively embodiments may automatically detect which temperature the device is at from the waveform data (again using probabilities, in a similar manner to that described above). A similar consideration/approach applies for different input modalities, e.g. pen/stylus/finger and so forth. Again, different sets of templates/parameters could be learned for different environments; again, optionally, embodiments may automatically detect which type of input mode is being employed from the waveform data (using the determined probabilities). Although we have described embodiments in which one of a set of (predetermined) tap-sensitive regions is identified, a variant of the approach may be employed to determine when a single tap-sensitive region is tapped, for example a region to wakeup a device. In this case a j = 2 model may be employed in which one of the regions is the region to be tapped, for example the wake-up region, and the other region comprises part or all of the remainder of the object/device. The invention also contemplates a simplified version of this in which the system is trained by tapping just a single region, in effect a j = 1 model and a probability p(y | y,n0) is determined. In such a case a simplified training regime may be employed, repeatedly tapping on the single touch-sensitive region. In some preferred embodiments of the above described procedures the touch-sensitive object is a portable electronic device, for example a mobile phone, PDA (personal digital assistant), laptop computer or the like. Preferably such a device incorporates a microphone which is used as the acoustic sensor. However in other applications an object may be made tap-sensitive by attaching an acoustic sensor, for example a microphone or accelerometer, and training a system to identify tapped regions, as previously described. In the above described approaches preferably mean value data and covariance data are employed, but potentially other models of the variability of the tapping waveforms may be employed, for example using a non-linear, non-Gaussian model, a Bayesian approach, or the like. Thus aspects of the invention contemplate other types of statistical data employed to represent variability of the captured tap waveforms, in particular in the context of a multi component model approach as described above. Thus we have also described a method of detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the method comprising: storing a set of labelled training data, said labelled training data comprising digitised waveform data of waveforms captured from said sensor for taps at a plurality of different locations on said object in combination with location data indicating for each said waveform the location of the tap; processing said labelled training data using a statistical model having a plurality of different parameters associated with each said region to determine from said waveforms, for each said region, statistical data representing the variability of said parameters resulting from tapping said object in said region; capturing tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap at an unknown location captured by said sensor; and determining a tapped region of said object from said tap data and said statistical data. The algorithms can be extended to classify taps that do not lie exactly on the training grid. This is important for devices where menu grids change during navigation, e.g. web browsing. In a simple version of this, templates and components are ‘interpolated’ to give new templates/components at new off-grid tapping positions and classification proceeds using these new templates at the new grid positions. This allows a continuous coverage of the whole screen in principle - ie. not grid-based at all. The algorithms can be extended to classify taps that do not lie exactly on the training grid.

This allows a continuous coverage of the whole screen in principle - ie. not grid-based at all. The inventive concept may also be extended/modified to identify off-grid tapping using interpolation of templates and/or covariance functions. Thus we have also described a method [and portions of the method implemented on a training computer system and on a portable electronic device] of detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the method comprising: storing a set of labelled training data, said labelled training data comprising digitised waveform data of waveforms captured from said sensor for taps at a plurality of different locations on said object in combination with location data indicating for each said waveform the location of the tap; processing said labelled training data to determine, for each of a plurality of tap-sensing regions of said object, statistical data comprising at least mean value data for at least two said waveforms captured from taps in the said region, said mean value data defining a mean of said at least two waveforms; processing said mean value data from said waveforms of a plurality of said regions to perform one or both of interpolation between and extrapolation from said means of said waveforms of said regions to provide mean value data defining waveform mean values at regions in addition to the regions used to capture said training data, preferably to increase a resolution at which mean value data for said regions is available; capturing tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap at an unknown location captured by said sensor; and determining a tapped region of said object from said tap data and said statistical data. In a simple implementation the captured tap data from an unknown location may be employed in a ML (maximum likelihood) or MAP (maximum apriori probability) or similar process, in combination with the interpolated/extrapolated mean value data, to identify the unknown tap location. However in more sophisticated approaches the statistical data statistical data may comprise further data, as previously described, for example covariance data and/or data defining one or more sets of basis functions. In such a case the statistical data may be used to determine probabilities for the unknown tap location along similar lines to those previously described, in particular to identify a most probable location for the tap. The aforementioned techniques relate to both capturing training data and to use of the training data to identify a tapped region of an object/device. However the skilled person will recognise that in many instances these two parts of the procedure will be separated so that, for example, training of a system might occur only once for, say, a particular handset or particular model of handset, for example under control of a manufacturer. However, in particular for a portable device as contrasted with an inert object to which an acoustic sensor has been attached, the identification of the tapped region will generally be lifted by software and/or hardware on the electronic device. Thus we also contemplate as separate aspects: 1. the portion of the methods described above implemented in a training phase in which classification data such as mean value data and covariance data, or statistical data, is determined for a touch-sensitive object/device; and 2. the portion of the above described procedures implemented on an electronic device processing a captured acoustic signal using the data previously derived from a training phase (classification data such as mean value data and covariance data, or other statistical data) to identify a most probably tapped region. Thus we have still further described a method of providing data for detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the method comprising: storing a set of labelled training data, said labelled training data comprising digitised waveform data of waveforms captured from said sensor for taps at a plurality of different locations on said object in combination with location data indicating for each said waveform the location of the tap; processing said labelled training data to determine, for each of plurality of tap-sensing regions of said object, mean value data and covariance data for at least two said waveforms captured from taps in the said region, said mean value data defining a mean of said at least two waveforms and said covariance data defining covariance of said at least two waveforms; storing said mean value data and said covariance data from said plurality of regions for use with captured tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap at an unknown location captured by said sensor for determining a tapped region of said object.. Similarly we have described a method of detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the method comprising: capturing tap data comprising a digitised waveform of a tap at an unknown location captured by said sensor; retrieving statistical data for a plurality of regions of said object wherein said statistical data comprises data characterising waveforms from said sensor when said object is tapped in each of a plurality of tap-sensing regions of the object; and determining said tapped region of said object from said tap data and from said statistical data for said plurality of regions. We have also described processor control code to implement the above-described systems and methods, for example on a general purpose computer system or on a digital signal processor (DSP). The code is provided on a carrier such as a disk, CD-or DVD-ROM, programmed memory such as non-volatile memory (eg Flash) or readonly memory (Firmware). Code (and/or data) to implement embodiments of the invention may comprise source, object or executable code in a conventional programming language (interpreted or compiled) such as C, or assembly code. As the skilled person will appreciate such code and/or data may be distributed between a plurality of coupled components in communication with one another. We have also described a computer system comprising a processor, working memory and programme memory, the programme memory storing processor control code to implement a method as described above. We have also described a computer system for providing data for detecting the location of a tap on an object having at least one acoustic sensor, the computer system comprising: an input to receive data from said acoustic sensor; working memory; program memory storing processor control code, and a processor coupled to said input, to said working memory and to said program memory; and wherein said program memory stores code for implementing a method as described above. We have also described an electronic device configured to detect the location of a tap on the device, the device comprising an acoustic sensor and processor control code to implement a method (or a portion of a method) identifying a tapped region) as described above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Acoustic touch (tap/swipe) sensing To facilitate understanding of the operation of embodiments of the invention we first describe examples of techniques which may be employed in embodiments of the invention for acoustic tap (and tap sequence) sensing. Similar techniques may be employed for swipe sensing, although potentially this may be made easier by providing a texture or pattern on the surface of an electronic device, such as a set or pattern of raised dimples or ribs which generate a characteristic acoustic or vibration signal when swiped. (The direction and/or location and/or length of a swipe may also optionally be encoded, for example by changing the spacing of the pattern with changing location on the surface of the device). Broadly speaking we will first describe approaches which involve a training phase in which one or more users taps repeatedly in one or more tapping modalities (stylus, finger, different temperatures) at specified locations on the device - e.g. on a carefully measured lattice of points on the screen surface of a mobile phone. (It has been found that there is variability caused by changes of temperature and change of device, e.g. different mobile phones of the same model). A training algorithm then learns templates and parameters used for subsequent classification of the data. Although such techniques are particularly advantageous, embodiments of the invention we describe later do not need to rely on such techniques and other, simpler forms of acoustic tap or swipe sensing may alternatively be employed (potentially much simplified for swipe sensing, as alluded to previously). Some suggestions are given in our W02009/093056 to which reference may be made. Random Process method We first describe our random process method. The main idea here is to model the variability in tapping styles, style of handset holding, different handsets (of the same model type) and environmental conditions using a multiple component model, see for example the templates learned from the MAP method under different temperatures. It appears that the temperature has a significant effect on the mean template - see Figure 8. Thus it seems questionable whether a simple ML or MAP method would be able to cope with this level of variation in tap waveform. Pulse variability has also been detected when users hold the devices in different ways, have the device on a surface and tap with nails or different styluses. One can label data based on position rather than the other factors mentioned above, and record the variability within the significant components. In this general approach the tapping waveform at each location is modelled as a random process, whose parameters are different at each tapping location. The process is non-stationary because of the nature of the tapping process. If a tap occurs at time index zi0 the tapping process is regarded as a random draw from a random process {x„;n0,j} where n0 is the tapping time and j is the tapping position. There is no reason to assume that the process is Gaussian, other than analytic tractability, and it is quite likely that non-Gaussian heavy-tailed processes could do a good job of modelling the tapping processes. However, for simplicity, consider the Gaussian Process as a specific case. Here we will model a mean function for the process μ1 of length M. and a covariance function c’^n^ = E[(x -μ^)(χ -/ζ„ζ)], defined for any pair of time indices 0<n1 <M}.+1, 0<n2 <M.+1, which may be compiled into a full covariance matrix C1, whose «p«2th element is c7(/ip/i2). Then, a tap occurs at time n0, the probability distribution for a sequence of measurements = is given by a multivariate Gaussian distribution that is obtained by time shifting the mean and covariance functions to the appropriate tap starting time n0: where such that the first non-zero element of μ1 (ηθ) is at position n0 and the n,m th element of C7(/i0) is defined Training of the mean and covariance functions for this process can be done by obtaining many time-aligned tapping pulses from each tapping position and computing the mean and covariance function for each: In the presence of zero-mean Gaussian background noise v : Α(0,Σν) the distribution of the observed data y = ,v + v is then straightforwardly obtained as In the classification algorithm this can be numerically evaluated using the following formula: The computation of the matrix inverse in this expression will simplify substantially in certain cases, notably in the case where the noise v is independent and hence has a diagonal covariance matrix. 1. Non-Gaussian extensions - scaled Gaussian processes While the Gaussian process models user and environmental variability, we may wish to separate out a tapping strength parameter from the model, the notion being that the tapping strength should affect only the amplitude of the waveform and not its shape (assuming here a linear system). This can be done by modelling the process as a scaled version of the random process, and hence moving to a scaled mixture of Gaussian Processes (i.e. now in the non-Gaussian arena): x = KX with the new observation being y = x'+v. We have immediately that and κ can be treated as a (positive-valued) random variable with prior pdf ρ(κ), for example a discrete point-mass distribution gamma, inverted-gamma, or the square-root versions of these. The most natural choice would be the square-root inverted gamma distribution since it yields an analytic result that p(x\ j,n0) is a multivariate Student distribution. We can now obtain a modified version of p(y\j,n0,x) as with the new observation being y = x'+v . We have immediately that In the discrete point-mass case the integral will drop out straightforwardly as a finite summation of weighted Gaussian terms (a ‘Gaussian mixture process’). In the continuous cases the integral can be approximated by a discrete summation or dealt with by more sophisticated computational tools such as Monte Carlo integration. 2. Classification method Classification of tapping position can then be achieved, for example, by Bayesian probabilities (classical or Maximum Likelihood would also work here): where p(y) could be computed as if required, but will not usually be necessary as it is constant for any given observed data y . p(y) can however be used for selecting between different modelling specifications. See below for more detailed discussion of how to perform classification decisions using Bayesian decision theory and expected cost. Multiple components method The multiple component model proposed here is also a Gaussian process model, with the covariance function expressed in a reduced dimension. As such, these methods are strictly a subset of those in the previous section on more general Gaussian processes, although in the multiple components case we develop the mathematical formulae separately here. We are appealing here to dimensionality reduction arguments from Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and its random process interpretation through the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT). Note that the extension to scale-mixture processes can be done in an exactly analogous fashion to that of the previous section. 1. Multiple Component Model Consider the case where a particular tapping position ye {1,2,...,7} occurs at a time index n0. A particular instance of a tap location j is modelled as a linear combination of one or more component waveforms f/m, of length M1 elements, where i is the component number. In addition each tapping position has a fixed mean component vector μ1 associated with it, also of length M1. At this stage, consider the component waveforms as fixed and known. In practice, these will need to be pre-specified or learned from training data, see later information. A particular tap occurs at a time index nQ, say, and we hence shift the component waveforms along to time n0 and form a shifted vector of template components: J(zio) = [o ... 0 t)2 ... 0 ... o] such that the first non-zero element of r/(«0) is at position nQ. Where the template component overshoots the end of the vector (i.e. when n0 +Mj-1 > N, where N is the length of the current data record), the component vectors are truncated in the obvious way. μ} is shifted to become /z7(zi0) in a similar way. We then assume a linear instantaneous model where a vector of time observations y = (^,...,^]7 are modelled as a noisy linear combination: (5) where t'(n0) is the ith template component out of a total of I components, shifted along to start at time n0, is the amplitude of the zth component and v = [v1,...,vjV]r. Take Θ. to be a random variable, vectorised to Θ7 =[#/,···,#/]r, describing the amplitude scale of each component i. &amp; is then taken to be a Gaussian random vector: (6) The noise v may be non-stationary, non-Gaussian, or both, and a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian background might be considered as a suitable option in noisy environments such as cafes where sudden loud noises are expected. However, for analytic tractability assume now that the noise background is a zero-mean Gaussian random vector: (non-zero mean can easily be incorporated as required). The simplest assumption for the background noise interference is independent and Gaussian: (7) and hence Σν = σν2ΙΎ where ΙΎ is the identity matrix of length N . It is straightforward to include a dependent Gaussian structure, such as an AR (auto-regression) or ARMA (auto-regression moving average) process, or a more general Gaussian process, in the mathematics, as desired, which would lead to non-identity forms for Σν. At this stage, we assume that μ3θ, Σ' and Σν are all pre-specified and known - in practice these would be obtained from prior reasoning or learned from training data. Considering this model in matrix notation: (8) where (9) The likelihood function for the data is now readily obtained as: (10) We have specified here a fully Gaussian model for parameters and likelihood. This substantially simplifies calculations and is used in the example calculations below, but we note that a non-Gaussian model may prove even more successful in the classification task at hand and can in principle be incorporated into our framework. 2. Multiple Component Detector/Classifier It is now possible to formulate a tap detector and classifier based on the above model. This could be done using classical detection theory, least squares-based fitting of the model, or Bayesian approaches. Here we focus on the latter Bayesian approaches for their simplicity and flexibility. The Bayesian approach will compute the posterior tap probability: di) pCm0\y') can be computed for all time-offsets n0 and all tap positions j and optimised: and (j,no) taken as the MAP estimate of tapping position and tap identity. Note that we will also wish to test the probability of the ‘null’ hypothesis, i.e. that there is just background noise present and no tap at all. We identify this hypothesis as the j = 0 case. Since only noise is present, the likelihood is just the probability of the noise process, i.e in the Gaussian case: p{j,nQ} is the prior for tap identity and tap position. A naive version of this, used successfully in our work, assigns all tap identities as equally probable at all times: where a is the probability that any tap has occurred in the time interval 1,K ,N. A more sophisticated version could incorporate that fact that some tap positions are more regularly used than others (e.g. common navigation functions), or the fact that there is temporal dependence between taps (if the previous tap was a particular type then the next tap is likely to be of another type,...). In practice the maximising value of p(j,n0\y) is monitored and a detection is only declared when p(j,n01 y) exceeds a threshold. It will often be convenient to look at the ratio of posterior probabilities for each j > 0 , since this avoids any calculation of the normalisation constant in p(J,n01 y)'* p(y\ and we can then monitor this ratio (or more conveniently) its logarithm, declaring a detection whenever it exceeds a pre-specified threshold. More generally, decision theory can be used to make the detection. If, for example, we are only interested in tap identity and not tap timing, we can compute instead: Alternatively, we may work directly with a cost function that expresses the cost of particular classification errors, C(j,j) and choose our estimate to minimise the expected cost: The cost function could, for example, penalise false detections more than false alarms, and so forth. Having described the general detection/classification framework, we now need to specify how to compute the marginal likelihood p(y | j,n0), as used for the posterior probability (11): The two terms in the integrand have already been specified in (6) and (10). Since they are both Gaussian we can perform this integral using standard Gaussian integral identities: (In the notation used, for clarity vectors/matrices are not always bolded and some superscripts/subscripts are omitted for clarity, eg j and n0 for t). Rearranging the exponent, we have: where: Hence the integral is given by: For posterior probability ratios we require the ratio of this likelihood to the ‘null’ j = 0 likelihood, since we have for the ratio: This Ratio simplifies the above expression somewhat: This is the general form of the result. Substantial simplifications arise from various useful special cases. In particular, consider the white noise case with Σν =diag(aj and the case of orthogonal components where t7(zi0)rt7(zi0) = I;. Then: Note in particular that the term tJ(n0)Ty can be computed for all n0 by a simple FIR filtering operation on y with coefficients given by the template component vector r/ (reversed in time ordering). Similarly, the data dependent terms in (y-/z'(zi0))rEj1(y-/z'(zi0)) can be computed by simple summing operations and a further filtering operation on y with coefficients μ}. Remaining terms can be precomputed and stored in advance of receiving the data. Moreover, if the prior covariance matrix for Θ' is diagonal, and the prior mean vector is zero, we have further simplifications in form. Consider now a case with μ® =0, in order to give a concrete example of the simplest computations that could be involved in the classfication process. Look first at β: where ‘FILTERYWITHT” is implemented for all values of n0 and j as a simple bank of J FIR filters applied to the data y , each filter having coefficients equal to one of the (time-reversed) component waveforms for tapping position j, and where is a constant vector for each tapping position which may be computed off-line and stored prior to running in use mode. Then, Φ is a diagonal matrix: and hence the inverse of Φ is just Then, θ' is obtained as a simple summation of terms: where the subscript i refers as before to the i th waveform component at tapping position j. Now, looking at the final expression for probability ratio we require: where as before ‘FILTERYWITHMU’ is implemented for all n0 and a particular j as an FIR filter operation applied to the data y , with coefficients equal this time to the (time-reversed) process mean vector μ]. Finally, the matrix determinant terms simplify to: Putting the whole thing together now into the steps for classification of a data sequence y , and highlighting the parts that can be pre-computed and stored, we have: START OF ALGORITHM: • Pre-trained/computed and stored in NVRAM for j = l:J β N by I - dimensional array μ' N - dimensional array σ j (/- dimensional array containing elements σ^ία,) TMU7 = βτμί MUTMU=^Jr/F, (scalar variable) • For each chunk of data y, of length N time samples: Determine background noise variance [this is the simplest version - just assume that background noise variance equals received signal energy]: • For j = 1: J - Compute ‘FILTERYWITHT’: For / = 1:/ Apply an FIR filter to the data y , the filter having coefficients equal to the corresponding (time-reversed) component waveform for tapping position j and component i, i.e. the time-reversed version of J . The output is an N -dimensional vector FILTERYWITHT/ for a particular value of j and i, and for all values of n0 = 1: N. End - Compute ‘FILTERYWITHMU’: Apply an FIR filter to the data y , the filtter having coefficients equal to the corresponding (time-reversed) mean process vector for tapping position j, i.e. the time-reversed version of μ1. The output is an N -dimensional vector FILTERYWITH1 for a particular value of j, and for all values of n0 = 1: N. - For n0 = 1: N • Calculate β, a vector of length I: • Compute @', a vector of length I: • Compute: • Compute log-likelihood ratio: LOGLIKERATIO = -log(DETSIGTHETAPHI) - • Compute Bayesian log-posterior probability ratio and store in as an N by J -dimensional array in RAM: LOGPOSTRATIO' = LOGLIKERATIO + LOGPRIORRATIO (14) ”0 End End • Find indices n0, j ,of maximum element of array LOGPOSTRATIO. If this maximum exceeds a fixed threshold, return j as the detected tap position and n0 as the detected tap time. Otherwise, return ‘no tap detected’. END OF ALGORITHM A special case of the above has /=1. Then the models reduce to a type of Bayesian matched filter/correlation detector. 3. Training the Multiple component model Several components of the model were assumed known in the last section, specifically t1, Σ',, μ®, μ1 and σν. These can all be learned from labelled training data, in which a user is prompted to tap one or more times (possibly many more than one) in all J specified tapping positions, according to some known deterministic or random pattern of positions, and possibly in a variety of tapping styles and environments. The parameters of the classification model are then learned. In one realisation of the training, the templates are drawn from a known dictionary of components, such as a wavelet, Fourier or Gabor dictionary. In this case the training algorithm will learn which elements of the specified dictionary should be used in the model, and also learn the prior distribution of the coefficients, i.e. the μθ and Σθ terms. The dictionary elements and their parameters can for example be learned using pursuit methods, or sparse Bayesian/ likelihood modelling methods. In another realisation, the template component vectors are automatically learned from the data, including their number. Sophisticated approaches based on independent component analysis and probability modelling are possible here, and would not necessarily deliver orthogonal components. A simple and successful approach however involved performing a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the aligned training data. This comprises a detection and alignment phase in which the training examples are all aligned in time using correlation matching or similar, and then orthogonal component vectors are computed by PCA for each tapping position. This is achieved by first subtracting the overall mean of the aligned training examples. This is then used as μ1 in the above detection procedure. Then the sample correlation matrix is obtained from the mean-corrected, aligned training data - both can be achieved as described in the section on Gaussian Processes. An eigenvector/eigenvalue decompostion is then applied to the sample correlation matrix. 2 The most significant eigenvalues of the correlation matrix are then used as the in the detection model. A threshold is used to determine the number of significant components to retain, i.e. the number of components I, which may be different for each tapping position. The corresponding eigenvectors then form the orthogonal set of template components J . This procedure is repeated for each tapping position j, returning different template components and variances for each j. In a refinement of the above paragraph, the learned template components are then used with the training data to form better estimates of the prior parameters Σ]&amp; , and possibly to learn non-zero values for the mean parameters μ}θ. In a further refinement the template vectors themselves are also refined, starting with the PCA vectors as an initialiser. The refined component vectors may or may not be orthogonal, depending on the details of the procedure. In the above approach, a separate set of template components and prior parameters is learned for each tapping position. In another version of our approach, a common set of template components is learned from the whole unlabelled training dataset, using the above PCA approach, or a more sophisticated approach such as probability modelling. Then, using these template components, separate prior parameters are learned for each tapping position, including most likely non-zero mean terms μ}θ. as well as possibly fully populated covariance matrix Σ^, In another version of the above, additional training data is obtained from many randomised tapping positions on the device, not generally coinciding with the tapping positions being currently trained. Template components are then learned by e.g. PCA from this entire randomised training set, and these templates are used for determining the prior parameters for labelled training data from the current training grid. This approach should lead to greater robustness to tapping variations, especially when detecting Off-grid’ taps (see later). 4. Background modelling The background noise parameter σ2 may be learned automatically from new data as it is received. In the simplest version we simply set σ2 equal to the mean-squared value of the current data y . This leads to a conservative over-estimate for the noise. In more refined versions outlier and spike removal are first employed in order to get a more reliable noise estimate. More generally, a correlated noise model may be estimated and incorporated directly through the noise covariance matrix Σν. This may be obtained by estimating the parameters of a corresponding autoregressive (AR) or autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model from the data and computing the corresponding covariance matrix. As above, robust estimation methods can be used to reduce the impact of the tap transients on the estimates. Ideally, a short section of data just before and/or after a candidate tap pulse would be used for this estimation. More generally, a Gaussian Process background model can be incorporated in a similar way. 5. Preconditioning of data It has been found beneficial to apply a high-pass filter to training and test data prior to training classification. This makes the algorithms much more robust in the presence of heavy background noise such as planes or trains or cars. 6. Adaptation of templates with time It is proposed to use good pulse detections over time to slowly adapt the template and prior model parameters. This is in anticipation of slow changes to the physical characteristics of the device over time. 7. Detection of off-grid taps The algorithms can be extended to classify taps that do not lie exactly on the training grid. This is important for devices where menu grids change during navigation, e.g. web browsing. In a simple version of this, templates and components are ‘interpolated’ to give new templates/components at new off-grid tapping positions and classification proceeds using these new templates at the new grid positions. This allows a continuous coverage of the whole screen in principle - i.e. not grid-based at all. 8. Multiple microphones All of the above have multiple microphone extensions that could perform better. 9. Low complexity detection stage Computation can be substantially reduced by running a low-complexity matched or correlation detector to find candidate tap positions. This would involve running one or at most a few FIR filters on the data, with coefficients based on e.g. a mean template from a large unlabelled training set. Even more can be saved by first running a short term energy detector and only trying the correlation detector once a high energy region is detected. Only when a strong candidate detection and alignment has been made is the full component-based detector be called into play. This substantially reduces computational burden. Implementation of some preferred embodiments In this embodiment we use the multi-component Gaussian model. Training is done by PCA analysis of the labelled training data. 1. Training A large quantity of labelled training data is digitally recorded from the acoustic sensor on the device and transferred onto a PC via an analogue or digital link. Here labelling means that we record which spot is being tapped along with the audio waveform itself. This will involve tapping many times at each spot located on the device. Tapping may be carried out using different styli, fingernail, fingerpad, different tapping strengths and styles, different handholds, different users, different environmental temperatures and indeed different examples of the same type of device (e.g. multiple handsets of the same model). This process is typically carried out once for each batch of handsets in the factory or in the laboratory, although it could be repeated later on in the life of the device. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a computer system configured to implement this method. Figures 3 and 5 show use of an internal microphone of a mobile phone to capture training data, Figure 4 shows a microphone-equipped inert object. In more detail, Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the implementation of the training algorithm. The training data ** is acquired by the user tapping multiple times on a specific spot / . The N taps in this data stream is then detected and aligned with each other as an ensemble in a matrix. Figure 1 shows this as and as the taps superimposed on each other in the little plot. From the ensemble the mean and the covariance matrix is computed, and from the covariance matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are derived. The ? largest eigenvalues are selected and the corresponding eigenvectors are stored as the templates while the eigenvectors are stored as For each tapping position, a single waveform corresponding to one representative tap is selected (by visual examination of the training data in an audio editor). This waveform is trimmed and used as the coefficients in a correlation detector which determines the alignment of all training taps from this tapping position. These aligned taps are then extracted, trimmed to the same length (typically around 0.005s long) and training of template components is carried out. Figure 6 shows an example of a waveform from a single tap, and Figure 7 two tap waveforms from each of two tap positions. Figure 9 shows example of time-aligned waveforms from a single tap-sensitive region showing the mean (thick line) and also the variability of these waveforms. First the mean and covariance functions are computed: Then the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of q1 are computed. The eigenvalues are then sorted by decreasing magnitude and a number of components to use is selected on the basis of how these decay towards zero. Figure 10 shows the decay of eigenvalues with component number, from a decomposed covariance matrix. Figure 12 indicates basis function (template) variability. The template components are then set equal to the eigenvectors which correspond to the highest eigenvalues, while the prior variances are set equal to the corresponding eigenvalues. In this embodiment the prior means are all then set to zero /4=0- Thus the training process yields the prior parameters for each tapping position, 2 2 E£=diag(a^ ) and the mean vectors /ζθ [=0 here]. 2. Testing/use mode In the use mode, audio is continuously recorded from the device. In the simplest version of the approach, this audio is then split up into chunks or frames of around 0.05s and each chunk is separately analysed to determine whether a tap has occurred and if so where the user tapped. (In more sophisticated implementations the data may be input sample by sample and classifications are updated on-line on a sample by sample basis - both versions fit with the above detailed mathematical framework). For each chunk of data y , of length N samples (where N is, say, of order 1000), loop over possible tap times n0 and tapping positions j: Determine background noise variance (this is the simplest version - just assume that background noise variance equals received signal energy): For 7 = 1:7 For n0 = 1: N Compute likelihood-ratio function: Compute Bayesian posterior probability ratio (i) End End Find maximum of over all 7' > 0 and n0. If the maximum exceeds a fixed threshold, return that detected 7' and n0 pair. Otherwise, return no detection (7 = 0). Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a portable electronic device configured to implement this method. Figure 13 shows an example of the acoustic signal of a tap embedded in noise; Figure 14 shows example basis functions (templates); and Figure 11 shows example detection statistics output data for the system of Figure 2 (dots indicate a detected tap). In more detail, Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the implementation of the use/testing stage of the algorithm. The diagram shows how a tap >' incident on the tapping device is picked up by the microphone on the device and transmitted to a computer. Within the computer the algorithm calculates the statistics, as outlined below, utilizing data from the training stage of the algorithm. The statistics of the signal is then evaluated and the most probable class or spot is displayed to the user unless the models do not yield a sufficiently high probability, as determined by a threshold, in which case no tap will be registered. 3. Testing/use mode for a Gaussian process model An alternative testing mode is obtained for the Gaussian process model. Recall that in this case only the means μ1 and covariances (f are required, so no eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition is performed in the training stage (otherwise training is identical). Testing then proceeds exactly as before, but using a different formula for the likelihood function /?(y|y,n0): For each chunk of data y , of length N samples, loop over possible tap times n0 and tapping position j: Determine background noise variance [this is the simplest version - just assume that background noise variance equals received signal energy]: For / = 1:7 For n0 =1: N Compute a likelihood-ratio function: Compute Bayesian posterior probability ratio (2) End End Find maximum of over all 7' > 0 and n0. If the maximum exceeds a fixed threshold, return that detected 7' and n0 pair. Otherwise, return no detection (7 = 0). 4. Testing mode for a simple case Here we give a very specific implementation for a simple case where noise is iid Gaussian, multi-component model is assumed with orthogonal components and the prior coefficient means are set to zero. The derivation of this is given above, and the algorithm is repeated there. Arrays are treated as column vectors throughout and dimensions are given as columns x rows. START OF ALGORITHM: • Pre-trained/computed and stored in NVRAM for 7 = 1:7 f (N by I - dimensional array) p' (N - dimensional array) σ j (/- dimensional array containing elements cfheta) LOGPRIORRRATIO = log(a) -log(l-a) -log(7) (scalar) TMU7 = t7 r/z7 > I ~ dimensional array MUTMU = pdpj, (scalar variable) • For each chunk of data y , of length N time samples: Determine background noise variance [this is the simplest version - just assume that background noise variance equals received signal energy]: • For j = 1: J - Compute ‘FILTERYWITHT’: For i = 1:1 Apply an FIR filter to the data y , the filtter having coefficients equal to the corresponding (time-reversed) component waveform for tapping position j and component i, i.e. the time-reversed version of r'. The output is an N -dimensional vector FILTERYWITHT' for a particular value of j and i, and for all values of n0 = 1: N. End - Compute ‘FILTERYWITHMU’: Apply an FIR filter to the data y , the filter having coefficients equal to the corresponding (time-reversed) mean process vector for tapping position j, i.e. the time-reversed version of μ1. The output is an N -dimensional vector FILTERYWITHMU' for a particular value of j, and for all values of n0 = 1: N. - For n0 = 1: N • Calculate β, a vector of length I: • Compute: • Compute log-likelihood ratio: • Compute Bayesian log-posterior probability ratio and store in as an N by J -dimensional array in RAM: LOGPOSTR ATIO' = LOGLIKERATIO + LOGPRIORRATIO «0 End End • Find indices nQ, j,of maximum element of array LOGPOSTRATIO. If this maximum exceeds a fixed threshold, return j as the detected tap position and n0 as the detected tap time. Otherwise, return ‘no tap detected’. END OF ALGORITHM 5. Other versions of the testing algorithm Other versions of the likelihood function, such as non-Gaussian models for the taps and/or the background noise, or the scaled mixture versions of the models also fit into a testing framework with a corresponding structure to that above, simply by replacing the calculation of the terms /?(y| j,nf and /?(y I y = Ο,ζιθ) with their alternative versions, for example using equation (6) for p(y | /,n0) when the scaled Gaussian mixture model is to be implemented. We have thus described a device as having one or more acoustical sensors and an algorithm which classifies tapping positions in the presence of user and environmental variability through use of a statistical model. In embodiments the model is a non-stationary random process having different parameters for each tapping position, time-shifted to coincide with the time of arrival of the tapping waveform: {xn-,nQ,j} where n0 is the tapping time and j is the tapping position. The random process may a Gaussian Process whose mean and/or covariance functions are parameterised differently for each tapping position: p(x\ j,n0) = Ν(μ}(nQ)),C}(n0)) where such that the first non-zero element of /z'(zz0) is at position n0 and the zz,mthe element of C'(n0) is defined In embodiments the statistical model is a random probability mixture of processes: More particularly the statistical model may be a random probability mixture of Gaussian processes: The statistical model may comprise multiple waveform components, each of which models one aspect of variability in the tapping process, and where the tapping waveform is modelled as a random combination of the individual components. In particular in embodiments the tapping random process is modelled as a linear weighted sum of the individual component waveforms and (optionally) a mean process: (2) where the weights Θ. are random variables. More particularly the random parameters are multivariate Gaussian: (3) In a statistical model as described above an additive background noise process v may be modelled as: which may be non-Gaussian or Gaussian, in a Gaussian example: For example in which the background is iid Gaussian, i.e. The background may be modelled as a correlated process, for example an AR or ARMA process, or general Gaussian process. The background parameters may be estimated from surrounding (non-tap, pure background) data or jointly from the whole data including the tap, optionally using outlier robust statistical methods, or by probabilistic modelling. Additionally or alternatively a classifier may be employed, in particular which uses measured tapping waveforms and any of the above statistical models (with or without background modelling) to determine (either or both) when (n0) and where (j) the user has tapped on the device. Likelihood-based or classical decision methods may be used to perform classification. Alternatively classification may be based on the Bayesian posterior probability (4) In particular in which the Maximum a Posteriori classification is chosen, for j >= 0: or Alternatively the Maximum Posterior probability ratio classification is chosen, for j > 0 : or and no tap classification is made (j = 0) unless the maximum value exceeds a prespecified threshold. Alternatively the classification is made using Bayesian Decision Theory: In the above procedures p(y | j,nf maY be computed as: Alternatively p(y\j,nA may be computed for y>0 as: In the above p(y | j,nfl p(y I j' = O,no) may be computed for j>Q as: In any of the above procedures labelled training data may be obtained from one or more users tapping in one or more different styles and in one or more environmental conditions. Preferably the labelled training tap data are detected and time-aligned using e.g. correlation-based detector (matched filter). Optionally the aligned data are preconditioned by energy or peak amplitude normalisation. In embodiments the mean and covariance functions are learned from labelled and aligned training data by: Where the tapping random process is modelled as a linear weighted sum of the individual component waveforms components and prior parameter variances may be obtained by Principal Components Analysis of the estimated covariance matrix. There are other more variants on the training that may be employed as previously indicated including, for example: randomised unlabelled training over whole surface to get a single set of component templates (plus estimation of prior parameters for each j from labelled training data); adaptation of templates over time, detection of off-grid taps; multiple microphones; a low complexity detection stage. The training and/or test/use data may be pre-conditioned by high-pass/low-pass filtering in order to attenuate low/high frequency interference. There are further options. For example one could employ a basic template based detector (eg MAP maximum apriori probability and/or ML maximum likelihood), and a corresponding training algorithm, implemented in a mobile device using matched filtering technology. The maths of the testing/use (tap identification) phase are a special case of the multiple component model when J = 1 and there is no mean process μί We have described, inter alia, a multiple component-based detector and its training algorithm. This algorithm is aimed at modelling variability between taps at the same physical point. Lots of training data is obtained and multiple components are estimated for each tapping point - this can be done in the simplest case by a Principal Components Analysis of the training taps - leading to orthogonal components, or using a more sophisticated model that leads to dependent components. As described, there are configuration options available - for example, learn different components for each tapping point, or have a common pool of components for all tapping points. In embodiments we model the background interference directly, learning the level of it automatically from non-tapping parts of the signal, but modelling it as white Gaussian noise. A possible extension is to learn the spectrum or autocorrelation function of the noise and build this into the detector - in effect using coloured rather than white noise. The maths can straightforwardly be adapted for this case. Once again, the spectrum can be estimated from non-tapping data. Other options include: High pass filtering/pre-processing to remove low-frequency variability; using sparse training and interpolation method applied in a basic single template mode; and using sparse training and interpolation, applied to PCA-type multiple component mode. The tap-characterising waveforms may change over time due to heavy use or damage to the phone. Thus in a multiple component model one could adapt the templates/components (basis functions) with time, preferably rather slowly. One could also provide a re-start function that recognises that the system is no longer working and that new tapping data needs to be input by the user for recalibration purposes. Additionally or alternatively methods for detecting ‘off-grid’ taps could be implemented, for example including randomised (location) training to learn the template components. Similarly methods for providing/using data for dealing with multiple temperatures and multiple handsets could be implemented. As previously described, computational savings may be made by implementing a reduced-complexity detection stage. The methods may be extended to provide scaling parameter estimation/marginalisation for multi-component model and/or classification in the presence of clipping/saturation. Adaptive acoustic touch sensing We now describe techniques for determining an automatic adaptive threshold in acoustic tap detection which may, in embodiments, employ a touch/tap-sensing algorithm as described above. In embodiments a method for determining an adaptive threshold for detection of taps in unknown background noise environments uses a detection method which outputs a series of detection values (e.g. probabilities), one for each data point in the series -such as the Bayesian detector we have previously described in WO2012/025733. High detection (probability values) indicate a potential tap, but how does one determine a suitable threshold for declaring a detected tap, especially when the background characteristics are unknown and do not necessarily fit with the assumptions of the detection model? In embodiments the steps are: 1. Find a piece of background noise where there are unlikely to be genuine taps 2. Add to this background noise one or more examples from the training library of 'clean’ taps, at one or more time locations in the background audio. 3. Apply a detection algorithm (e.g. the patented Bayesian tap detector) to the waveform(s) generated in 2. And also to the pure background noise data (without taps added). 4. Look at the detector output(s) from 3. and use the magnitudes to determine an appropriate threshold for the detector running on real data with potential real taps. For example, calculate the maximum detector output from just background noise in 3., then calculate the minimum detector output at the time location of a synthetically added tap from 3. and compute a threshold some fraction of the distance between these, say halfway between them. Extensions include determining thresholds for a multi-spot classifier by adding in examples from the training library for different spots and computing thresholds for each tap type detector output. One can also use the method to effectively deactivate the detector in regions where the minimum and maximum values in step (4) are too close to reliably make detections. In one embodiment step 1 is implemented as follows: take a buffer of data, run a detector on it (e.g. a correlation or Bayes detector) and cut out the sample locations in a short region around where the detector output is highest. The remaining data can be treated as 'background’ data and used in step (2). One may not wish to run detector(s) in step (2) over boundaries where data was cut out, but this can be addressed in the software. In another embodiment step 1 performs the following: use other sensor(s) e.g. accelerometer or gyro to determine regions with little or no tap activity, and treat these as the background noise in step (1). This has been implemented in Matlab (RTM) and Android (RTM) environments. Referring now to figure 15, this shows an embodiment of an adaptive touch sensing device 1500 according to the present invention. The device comprises a microphone 1504, a speaker or earpiece 1506, user controls/switches 1508, an antenna 1512, as well as a processor and working memory (not shown), and non-volatile program memory 1510, for example Flash memory.

3977,ES-2689844-T5,Use of an infant formula containing sweet whey to promote postnatal neural development of the infant's digestive tract and the establishment of the intestinal functions it controls ,2013,"DESCRIPTION Use of an infant formula containing sweet whey to promote postnatal neural development of the infant's digestive tract and the establishment of the intestinal functions it controls field of invention The present invention relates, in general, to the field of neuronal health, protection and development. The invention specifically relates to the administration of sweet whey protein to promote enteric neuronal development in infants, especially preterm, low, very low, and extremely low birth weight infants. Background of the invention The nervous system is a very complex network, made up of neurons and glia. It is present in all mammalian species and is composed of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems). The central nervous system directs cognitive functions (memory, attention, perception, action, etc.). Together with the peripheral nervous system, it has a fundamental role in behavior control. The somatic nervous system is responsible for the coordination of bodily movements (with conscious control). The autonomic nervous system maintains homeostasis in bodily activities without conscious control (heart rate, etc.). Finally, and as part of the last system, the enteric nervous system directly controls the functions of the digestive tract. These include the immune and barrier function, motility, absorption, digestion and exocrine/endocrine secretions of the digestive tract, which contribute to the protection of the intestine against any type of injury and to the well-being of the digestive system [Neunlist, M et al. (2008); Neuroglial crosstalk in inflammatory bowel disease, J Intern. Med, 263: 577-583], [Burns, A.J. et al. (2009); Development of the enteric nervous system and its role in intestinal motility during fetal and early postnatal stages, Semin. Pediatric Surg., 18: 196-205], [Tapper E.J. (1983); Local modulation of intestinal ion transport by enteric neurons, Am J Physiol., 244: G457-68]. The nervous system develops during gestation and is then redefined into a mature and functional network during the postnatal (after birth) period. Due to the critical role of the enteric nervous system in digestive function, immaturity or delayed maturation of the nervous system will lead to a delay in the establishment and proper functioning of major digestive functions. In particular, it will contribute to: • immaturity of digestive motility [Burns, A.J. et al. (2009); Development of the enteric nervous system and its role in intestinal motility during fetal and early postnatal stages, Semin. Pediatric Surg., 18: 196-205], which will result in slower intestinal transit with harder stools that will lead to intestinal discomfort and, in most cases, extreme constipation, with a greater predisposition of the baby to enteral feeding intolerance, to a need for total parenteral nutrition and, in more severe cases, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (Grave GD, Nelson SA, Walker WA, Moss RL, Dvorak B, Hamilton FA, Higgins R, Raju TN. New therapies and preventive approaches for necrotizing enterocolitis: report of a research planning workshop Pediatr Res. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2011 Oct;24 Sup. 1:64-6 • reduce intestinal digestive/absorptive capacity [Tapper, E.J. (1983); Local modulation of intestinal ion transport by enteric neurons, Am J Physiol., 244: G457-68]; Josef Neu and Liyan Zhang, Feeding intolerance in very low birth weight infants: What is it and what can we do about it? Pediatric Act 2005; 94(sup. 449): 93-99] • immaturity of intestinal barrier function [Neunlist, M. et al. (2008); Neuroglial crosstalk in inflammatory bowel disease, J Intern. Med, 263: 577-583, Burns, A.J. et al. (2009)], which increases the risk of infections, enteral feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [Athalye-Jape G, More K, Patole S Progress in the field of necrotizing enterocolitis--year 2012.. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med . May 2013; 26(7): 625-32; Indrio F, Riezzo G, Cavallo L, Di Mauro A, Francavilla R. Physiological basis of food intolerance in VLBW. J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med Oct 2011; 24 Sup. 1: 64-6] An immature or affected enteric nervous system can be seen in babies such as: - Premature, low (<2500 g), very low (<1500 g) and extremely low (<1000 g) birth weight babies; New J. Digestive development and meeting the nutritional needs of premature infants Am J Clin Nutr 2007; 85(2): 629S-634S. - Premature or full-term babies with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) produced after any adverse event during pregnancy (mother who smokes, mother with drug treatment, low  quality of the placenta, incorrect placement of the placenta, malnutrition of the mother and fetus, excessive stress/anxiety of the mother, etc.); [Shanklin DR and Cooke RJ (1993); Effects of intrauterine growth on intestinal length in the human fetus, Biol Neonate, 64:76-81], [Neu, J. (2007); Digestive development and meeting the nutritional needs of premature infants, Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 85(2): 629S-634S], [Brandaoa, MCS et al., (2003); Effects of pre- and postnatal protein energy deprivation on the myenteric plexus of the small intestine: a morphometric study in weanling rats, Nutr. Res., 23: 215-223]. - Any neonate and young child showing growth retardation of the nervous system after, for example, hypoxemia-ischemia at birth or any other adverse event [Taylor, C.T. and Colgan S.P. (2007); Hypoxia and digestive disease, J. Mol. Med. (Berl.), 85:1295-300], [Barrett R.D. et al. (2007); Destruction and reconstruction: hypoxia and the developing brain, Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today, 81: 163-76]. - Any neonate and young child showing digestive disturbances (digestive disorders, related motility disorders, GI reflux, slow GI tract, intolerance to oral feeding), Hirschsprung's disease and inflammation involving the GI tract (such as necrotizing enterocolitis) and obstruction-related pathologies [Burns A.J. et al. (2009); Development of the enteric nervous system and its role in intestinal motility during fetal and early postnatal stages, Semin. Pediatr Surg., 18(4): 196-205]. It is known that, in humans, the neural crest cells, from which the enteric nervous system derives, develop in the fetus when it is in utero, very early after conception (from 7.5 weeks of development) [Burns, A. J. & Thapar, N. (2006); Advances in ontogeny of the enteric nervous system, Neurogastroenterol. Motil., 18, 876-887]. The enteric nervous system has been observed to undergo major changes after birth up to six years, continuing with more minor changes up to ten years [Wester, T. et al. (1999); Notable postnatal alterations in the myenteric plexus of normal human bowel, Gut, 44: 666-674]. Therefore, if the fetus, neonate or infant has had a delay in the growth of the nervous system, it is desirable that this delay be rapidly reversed such that the development of the nervous system ""reaches"" a normal level. It is desirable that any damage caused to the enteric nervous system be repaired as soon as possible, so that the fetus or growing infant hardly suffers from intestinal disturbances or other pathologies associated with an immature or damaged enteric nervous system. Thus, the healthy development of the enteric nervous system in the fetus, neonate, and growing child helps to control the proper establishment and maintenance of intestinal motility, intestinal barrier function, and thus the absorptive and digestive functions of the intestinal tract. intestine. This prevents inflammatory disease states associated with intestinal disorders and also reduces the risk of infections and allergies (Neunlist et al. 2008) Therefore, postnatal interventions correspond to a promising strategy to ensure the healthy development of the enteric nervous system. There is a need to promote and reinforce the healthy development and/or repair of the enteric nervous system during the early phases of the newborn's life, when the nervous system matures rapidly. Since the nervous system continues to develop during the early years of childhood (up to about ten years of age), during this period of time there is this need for continuous reinforcement. In particular, there is a need to support the healthy development of the enteric nervous system in neonates, infants, and young children, to better prepare them for digestive challenges such as dietary changes, chemicals (eg, medications), or physical injury (abrasion ), infections, inflammatory/immune reactions, etc., as well as to enhance the future maturation of their enteric nervous system during later life. For this purpose or related purposes, compositions comprising lactoferrin, probiotics, soluble fiber and/or LCPUFA (Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) have been disclosed, for example, in documents US 2012/0184483; US 2012/0219526; EP 2609813; US 2007/0031537 and US 2013/0280225. There is a need to improve said booster or said related composition, in a way that is well accepted by the population in question, in particular those populations that are more fragile and need it the most. There is a further need not to induce disadvantages, side or negative effects in said population. There is a need to provide such solutions to the populations in question in a simpler and more cost-effective manner. The present invention applies to humans. Summary of the invention The invention is defined by the claims and refers to the use of sweet whey protein (SLP) to promote healthy development and/or repair the enteric nervous system in neonates. The sweet whey protein may be modified sweet whey protein (MLDP), from which the caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) has been removed. PLD can be partially or extensively hydrolyzed. More specifically, the present invention relates to  sweet whey protein for use in the prevention and treatment of at least one disorder associated with an immature or affected enteric nervous system in an infant or young child, wherein the sweet whey protein is administered to the infant or young child as a daily dose of 30 to 80% of total protein intake. The administration of sweet whey protein promotes the normal and healthy development of neurons and glial cells in the intestine. It also ensures healthy neural differentiation in the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, the administration of the PLD according to the invention prevents and treats disorders associated with an immature or affected enteric nervous system. Administration of the PLD according to the invention promotes the healthy development and/or repair of the enteric nervous system in small mammals. The disorder may be intestinal barrier dysfunction, food intolerance, or necrotizing enterocolitis. The disorder may be one that is directly associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction. More generally, the disorder may be dysfunctional digestive motility that may manifest as reduced intestinal transit, intestinal discomfort, hard stools, constipation, and/or digestive reflux. Sweet whey protein can be administered to a premature or full-term baby. Administration can also be to a child, generally up to six years of age, or the equivalent age in an animal. Sweet whey protein can be administered directly to the baby, or to the baby who is already taking his first steps (toddler),in its pure form, or diluted in water or breast milk, in a food supplement, or together with a milk fortifier or any Milk booster used during trophic feeding, in a baby formula, or in a milk drink. Sweet whey protein is administered to the infant or young child as a daily dose of 30 to 80%, preferably 60% w/w, of the total protein intake. The administration period for the infant or young child is generally at least 4 months, preferably 2-12 months, and more preferably at least 18 months and even more preferably until the child is six years old. PLDM can be given to a premature or full-term infant, or to a child or young adult, as a dose of 1.6-3.2 g protein/100 kcal, preferably 1.6-2.2 g protein /100 kcal, and more preferably 1.8-2.1 g protein/100 kcal. In one embodiment, the PLDM is administered to the child as a dose of 1.0 to less than 1.6 g protein/100 kcal. The invention relates to a composition comprising 30-80%, preferably 60% sweet whey protein, for the prevention or treatment of disorders associated with the immature or affected enteric nervous system in a young mammal. Also disclosed is the use of a PLD, and more particularly compositions comprising 30-80% w/w PLD, to promote healthy development and/or repair the enteric nervous system in young mammals.

In this specification, any reference to prior art documents should not be taken as an admission that the prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in this field. Dietary proteins provide the essential amino acids necessary for protein synthesis and growth, and the quality of the protein is just as important as its quantity. The present invention provides a sweet whey protein for use by administration to promote healthy development of the mammalian enteric nervous system. Sweet whey can be obtained from cheese making, particularly sweet whey obtained from the coagulation of casein by rennet. The sweet whey protein of the invention comprises 30-100% w/w protein, preferably >80% w/w protein. An example of a PLD that can be used in accordance with the invention is a PLD marketed under the trade name Lacprodan Di9224™. Thus, the PLD may be in the form of a sweet whey protein isolate or a sweet whey protein concentrate. According to one embodiment of the invention, the sweet whey protein is a modified sweet whey fraction, ie it is a sweet whey protein having a reduced level of caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) compared to a classical sweet whey protein. This fraction of sweet whey is called Sweet Modified Whey (MLDM). A classic sweet whey can contain from 4 to 40% CGMP depending on the processing of the milk. The protein fraction in cow's milk is a mixture of various proteins, all with a different amino acid profile. Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) is derived from the proteolysis of kappa-casein into parakappa-casein, an insoluble fraction that remains in the casein fraction, and CGMP, a soluble fraction that is found in the whey fraction. This CGMp-reduced whey fraction or SLDM provides the advantage of reduced threonine content and increased tryptophan content compared to normal sweet whey and is therefore suitable as a protein source for infants. . This sweet whey fraction can be further treated to remove minerals (cations, anions), lactose or any of these substances. The sweet whey can be concentrated as desired. Suitable sources of sweet whey are commercially available. Removal of the caseinoglycomacropeptide can be accomplished by any suitable process. A suitable process is described in EP0880902. In this process, the pH of the sweet whey is adjusted from 1 to 4.3, if necessary. The sweet whey is then contacted with a weakly anionic resin that is predominantly alkaline until the pH of the sweet whey stabilizes at about 4.5 to 5.5. Then, the sweet whey fraction, from which a significant amount of caseinoglycomacropeptide is removed, is collected. According to one embodiment of the invention, this CGMP-reduced whey protein fraction contains approximately 28% protein, of which CGMP represents 2-3% of total protein, and is therefore designated ""PLDM28"". SLDM for use according to the invention may, of course, contain a higher percentage of protein than in PLDM28, for example 30 to 99% protein. Similarly, the SLDM for use according to the invention may also contain a higher percentage of CGMP than in PLDM28, eg up to 15, 20, 25 or 35% of total protein. According to another embodiment of the invention, the sweet whey protein is unmodified and comprises a minimum of 50% protein. For example, PLD sold under the trademark Lacprodan Di9224™ from Aria Foods Ingredients, Skanderborgvej 277, 8260 Viby J, Denmark, contains 87% protein. Other examples of commercially available unmodified sweet whey protein for use in accordance with the invention are Lacprodan DI-8790, another sweet whey from Aria, 894 Instantised and MPC 485 available from Fonterra (New Zealand), YV0608, Armor Protéines (France) and BiPro, Davisco Food International inc (US, 11000 West 78th Street, Suite 210, Eden Prairie, MN 55344). Sweet whey protein may be non-hydrolyzed. Alternatively, according to some embodiments of the invention, the sweet whey protein is partially or extensively hydrolyzed to prevent allergic reactions from occurring in babies at risk of allergy and to make the protein easier to digest. The hydrolysis process can be carried out as desired and as known in the art. In general, the whey protein hydrolyzate is prepared by enzymatically hydrolyzing the sweet whey fraction in one or more steps. For example, for an extensively hydrolyzed protein, sweet whey proteins can be subjected to triple hydrolysis using, for example, Alcalase 2.4L (EC 940459), then Neutrase 0.5L (available from Novo Nordisk Ferment AG) and then pancreatin at 55°C. . Alternatively, for a less hydrolyzed protein, sweet whey can be double hydrolyzed using, for example, NOVOZYMES and then pancreatin. If the sweet whey protein used is substantially free of lactose, the protein is found to undergo much less lysine blockage during the hydrolysis process. This allows the degree of lysine blockage to be reduced from about 15% by weight of total lysine to less than about 10% by weight of lysine; for example about 7% by weight of lysine. This greatly improves the nutritional quality of the protein source. The administration of the PLD can be to a premature or full-term baby directly. Administration may also be to a small child, generally up to the age of four years or equivalent age in an animal. Administration of LPD to the young mammal, which can be a human (infant, toddler or toddler) or animal, has a positive effect on the development of its enteric nervous system, which allows the system to mature and develop normally. Thus, administration of the sweet whey protein according to the invention prevents and treats disorders associated with an immature or affected enteric nervous system. These disorders can be, for example, intestinal barrier dysfunction, food intolerance or necrotizing enterocolitis. These latter states increase the risk of infections and allergies, thus leading to food intolerance (hence the need for parenteral nutritional support). More generally, these disorders can be dysfunctional digestive motility that can manifest as slow intestinal transit, intestinal discomfort, hard stools, constipation and/or digestive reflux. The beneficial effect of the invention is especially directed at those young mammals that have had, for example, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) that may have occurred after any adverse event during pregnancy (for example, a passive or active smoking mother, a mother with pharmacological treatment, low quality of the placenta, incorrect placement of the placenta, malnutrition of the mother and/or fetus, etc.). The present inventors have discovered that PLD and/or PLD-containing compositions of the present invention can be used to promote the development, functionality, survival, plasticity and differentiation of neurons and to protect them against degeneration, as shown by promoting the expression of proteins associated with those biological activities. In infants, PLD and/or PLD-containing compositions of the present invention can be used to protect the enteric nervous system from any type of stress, for example, occurring during the period of neuronal development and - consequently - limit and/or prevent stress-induced neuronal growth retardation and associated intestinal dysfunctions. Therefore, PLD can be administered, in the context of the present invention, when a delay in the development of the enteric nervous system has already been observed or, prophylactically, when such a delay has not yet been observed. The beneficial effect of PLD on the healthy development of the mammalian enteric nervous system is described in more detail in the following paragraphs. PLD dose: Sweet whey protein can be given to infants or young children at a dose of 1.6-3.2 g protein/100 kcal, preferably 1.6-2.2 g protein/100 kcal and even more preferably 1.8-2.1 g of protein/100 kcal. For premature babies there are specific recommendations, published by the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition, about the amount of protein they should receive. For premature babies with a birth weight of less than 1 kg, the recommended protein intake is 3.6 to 4.1 g protein/100 kcal. For babies with a birth weight between 1 and 1.8 kg, the recommended intake of protein content is 3.2 to 3.6 g protein/100 kcal [Agostini et al (2010) JPGN 2010 (50), 1, Enteral Nutrient Supply for Preterm Infants]. Therefore, the amount of PLD administered to a premature infant is appropriately tailored based on current recommendations. For example, if according to one embodiment of the invention the PLD has a protein content of 100% and the PLD represents 80% of the total protein that is administered to the premature infant, then a suitable amount of PLD to be administered to the premature infant is 2.8-3.2 g per 100 kcal for babies whose body weight is less than 1 kg and 2.5-2.9 g for babies whose body weight is 1 kg-1.8 kg. The dose of PLD administered is such that the subject's protein intake is within appropriate guidelines (eg, WHO and ESPGHAN Committee recommendations). For example, in a preferred embodiment, a composition comprises from about 9.0 to about 10.0% w/w protein, more preferably about 9.5% w/w. This corresponds to approximately 1.8 g protein/100 kcal. An advantage provided by this protein concentration is that it is equivalent to the amount of protein generally present in human milk and corresponds to the lower limit described in theCodex Alimentarias(Food Code). In general, the PLDM can represent between about 70 to about 100% of the total protein in the composition. Thus, it can also represent 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% of the protein in the composition. Thus, the sweet modified whey protein of the invention can generally be administered to an infant or young child as a dose of 1.6-3.2 g protein/100 kcal, preferably 1.6-2.2 g protein. /100 kcal and even more preferably 1.8-2.1 g protein/100 kcal. Administration method: (i) Administration to infants: PLD can be administered directly orally to infants, alone (pure or diluted in water or breast milk, for example) as a food supplement (for example, as or in conjunction with a fortifying human milk supplement), or as any milk booster used during trophic feeding, or as a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical composition, or as an ingredient in infant milk formula. Said formula can be a ""preterm formula"" if the offspring is born before term or has a low birth weight, a ""starter formula"" or a ""continuation formula"". The formula can also be a hypoallergenic (HA) formula in which cow's milk proteins are hydrolyzed. An example of such a start formula is given in Example 2. PLD can be administered as a growth milk or in any milk drink. (ii) Administration to young children: PLD can also be administered orally to young children in the form of a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical composition, growth milk, dairy drinks, food supplements, dairy yogurts, desserts and puddings, cookies and cereal bars, cereals, and fruit-based drinks. (iii) Administration to pregnant or lactating mothers: PLD can also be administered to pregnant or lactating mothers orally, preferably in food, drink, food supplement or pharmaceutical composition. (iv) Administration to animals: The PLD can also be administered orally to animals alone, or in water or in the form of a food supplement, a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical composition, or milk or feed. Administration with other compounds: PLD can be administered alone (pure, or diluted in water or milk, including breast milk, for example) or in a mixture with other compounds (such as food supplements, nutritional supplements, medicines, vehicles, flavorings, digestible or indigestible ingredients). ). Vitamins and minerals are examples of typical food supplements. In a preferred embodiment, the PLD is administered in a composition, eg, in infant formula, together with other compounds that enhance the described beneficial effect in young mammals. For example, this can be a probiotic. Other probiotics can also be administered. Preferably, for this purpose, the probiotic can be selected from the group consisting ofBifidobacteria, Lactobacillas, Lactococcas, Enterococcas, Streptococcas, Klayveromyces, Saccharoymces, Candida,in particular selected from the group consisting ofBifidobacteriam longam, Bifidobacteriam lactis, Bifidobacteriam animalis, Bifidobacteriam breve , Bifidobacteriam infantis, Bifidobacteriam adolescentis, Lactobacillas acidophilas, Lactobacillas casei, Lactobacillas paracasei, Lactobacillas salivarías, Lactobacillas lactis, Lactobacillas rhamnosas, Lactobacillas johnsonii, Lactobacillas plantaram, Lactobacillas salivarías, Lactococcas lactis, Enterococcas faeciam, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces boalardiio mezclas de los mismos , preferably selected from the group consisting ofBifidobacteriam longamNCC3001 (ATCC BAA-999),Bifidobacteriam longamNCC2705 (CnCm 1-2618),Bifidobacteriam longamNCC490 (CNCM 1-2170),Bifidobacteriam lactisNCC2818 (CNCM 1-3446),Bif idobacteriam brevestrain A,Lactobacillas paracaseinCc2461 (CNCM 1-2116),Lactobacillas johnsoniiNCC533 (CNCM 1-1225),Lactobacillas rhamnosasGG (ATCC53103),Lactobacillas rhamnosasNCC4007 (CGMCC 1.3724),Enterococcas faeciam SF 68(NCC2768; NCIMB10415), and their mixtures. Other examples of synergistic compounds that can be included in the compositions of the invention, especially in infant formulas, are prebiotic compounds. A prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially influences the recipient by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or more bacteria in the colon, thus improving its health. These ingredients are non-digestible in the sense that they are not broken down or absorbed in the stomach or small intestine and therefore pass intact to the colon, where they are selectively fermented by beneficial bacteria. Examples of prebiotics include certain oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), cow's milk oligosaccharides (OSLV) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). A combination of prebiotics can be used, such as 90% GOS with 10% short-chain fructooligosaccharides such as the solid product sold under the trademark Raftilose® or 10% inulin such as the product sold under the trademark Raftiline®. Other examples of prebiotics that can be used in the context of the present invention include the group of oligosaccharides obtained from milk or other sources, optionally containing sialic acid, fructose, fucose, galactose or mannose. The preferred prebiotics are sialooligasaccharides (SOS), fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO), xylooligosaccharides (XOS), arabinoxylooligosaccharides (AXOS), mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), soybean oligosaccharides, glycosylsucrose (GS), lactosucrose ( LS), sialyl-lactose (SL), fucosyl-lactose (FL), Lacto-N-Neotetraose (LNNT), lactulose (LA), palatinosaoligosaccharides (PAO), maltooligosaccharides, gums and/or hydrolysates thereof, pectins, starches and/or hydrolysates thereof. An infant formula according to the invention preferably further contains at least one prebiotic in an amount of 0.3 to 10% of the total dry weight of the composition. In particular, oligosaccharides from human milk can be included in the composition according to the invention, for example sialylated oligosaccharides, described in WO 2012/069416 published May 31, 2012. These latter oligosaccharides can act synergistically with PLD of the invention for promoting the healthy development of the mammalian enteric nervous system in the infant or young child. The daily dose of carbohydrates, and other components administered with the PLD must always comply with published safety guidelines and regulatory standards. This is particularly important with regard to administration to newborn infants, especially those born with low, very low, or extremely low birth weights. A composition, eg an infant formula, containing the PLD for administration according to one embodiment of the invention, may contain an additional protein source in an amount such that the total protein is not more than 4.0, 3, 0 or 2.0 g/100 kcal, preferably 1.8 to 2.0 g/100 kcal. It is preferred that greater than 50% by weight of the protein source is whey, including Sweet Whey Modified (SLDM) and/or Sweet Unmodified Whey. The type of additional protein source is not considered critical to the present invention as long as the minimum requirements for essential amino acid content are met and satisfactory growth is ensured. In one embodiment, the protein content ranges from 30% to 80% whey protein. Therefore, additional protein sources such as skim milk, casein or soy can be used. In one embodiment, the casein/whey ratio ranges from 70/30 to 20/80. The proteins can be intact or hydrolyzed or in a mixture of intact and hydrolyzed proteins. It may be desirable to provide partially hydrolyzed proteins (with a degree of hydrolysis between 2 and 20%), for example, for babies thought to be at risk of developing cow's milk allergy. If hydrolyzed proteins are required, the hydrolysis process can be performed as desired as known in the art. The composition may also comprise a carbohydrate source and/or a fat source. Baby formula may contain a source of lipids. The lipid source can be any lipid or fat that is suitable for use in infant formulas. Preferred fat sources include palm oil, high oleic sunflower oil, and high oleic safflower oil. Essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid may also be added. One or more long-chain essential fatty acids (LC-PUFA) may be included in the composition. Examples of LC-PUFA that can be added include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). The LC-PUFAs can be added at concentrations such that they constitute more than 0.01% of the fatty acids present in the composition. Oils containing high amounts of preformed arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, such as fish oils or microbial oils, may be added as small amounts. Palmitic acid may be added, preferably at the Sn-2 position. In total, the fat content is preferably such that it provides a percentage between 30 to 55% of the total energy of the formula. The fat source preferably has a ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids of from about 5:1 to about 15:1; for example, from about 8:1 to about 10:1. An additional source of carbohydrates can be added to the nutritional composition. Preferably, it provides about 40% to about 80% of the energy of the nutritional composition. Any suitable carbohydrate may be used, for example, sucrose, lactose, glucose, fructose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, or a mixture thereof. If desired, additional dietary fibers may also be added. If added, they preferably comprise up to about 5% of the energy of the nutritional composition. The additional dietary fiber may be of any suitable source, including, for example, soybean, pea, oat, pectin, guar gum, acacia, oligosaccharides including FOS, GOS and those described above, or a mixture thereof. . Suitable vitamins and minerals may be included in the nutritional composition in an amount that meets the appropriate guidelines. Examples of minerals, vitamins and other nutrients optionally present in infant formula include vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B 12, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, inositol, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, phosphorus, iodine, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, manganese, chlorine, potassium, sodium, selenium, chromium, molybdenum, taurine, and L-carnitine. Normally, the minerals are added in the form of salt. The presence and amounts of specific minerals and other vitamins will vary depending on the child population for which they are intended. The infant formula may optionally contain other substances, such as fibers, lactoferrin, nucleotides, nucleosides, and the like, which may have a beneficial effect. One or more food grade emulsifiers may be included in the nutritional composition, if desired; for example, tartaric acid diacetyl esters of mono- and di-glycerides, lecithin and mono- or di-glycerides or a mixture thereof. Similarly, suitable salts and/or stabilizers may be included. Flavorings may be added to the composition. Administration period: The term of administration may vary. When positive effects are expected with a relatively short time of dosing (for example, daily dosing for one to two weeks for neonates), longer times are thought to provide a potentiated effect, or at least maintain the effect in older infants (for example, within three, five, eight, or 12 months) or in children (for example, within 2 or 4 or 6 years). For administration to animals, the corresponding deadlines apply. (iv) Administration to animals: Sweet modified whey protein or standard sweet whey protein is given directly to the baby. This is particularly the case if the mother does not breastfeed or after she stops breastfeeding. However, a breastfed infant can also receive modified sweet whey protein or standard sweet whey protein by direct administration. Preferably, the administration to the baby is by daily intake. For example, if the modified sweet whey protein or sweet whey protein is administered as an infant formula, the administration is with each feeding, that is, from approximately four to approximately six times a day for infants, the number of feedings being reduced with the age. For young children (over one year), the administration may be less, once or twice a day. For babies who are already taking their first steps and children up to six years of age, the administration is recommended for the consumption of milk for growth and development. Administration to the baby by direct administration may continue up to six months or even a year or more. Therefore, modified sweet whey protein or standard sweet whey protein can be administered during lactation, if it occurs, or after partial or total weaning. The administration can continue throughout the baby stage that already takes its first steps and even up to six years. It is known that the enteric nervous system continues to develop in children up to this later age [Wester, T. et al. (1999); Notable postnatal alterations in the myenteric plexus of normal human bowel, Gut, 44: 666-674]. Therefore, the present inventors speculate that administration of modified sweet whey protein or standard whey protein may continue to have a positive effect, generally up to six years. Effect of the administration of the standard PLDM or PLD: Modified sweet whey protein, or standard sweet whey protein, given to neonates promotes healthy development of the enteric nervous system. In a rat model experiment detailed in Example 1, the effect of administration of a modified sweet whey protein (PLDM28) or a commercially available sweet whey protein (Lacprodan Di9224) on neuronal development was evaluated. In this experiment, pups that had had maternal diet-induced intrauterine growth retardation (RP group) and pups that had not had IUGR (CTRL) were supplemented, starting 2 days after birth, with water (controls; particularly CTR-a and RP-a) or with one of the following milk fractions:  - Lacprodan DÍ9224: Whey protein isolate, sweet whey, marketed by Arla Foods Ingredients, The Netherlands. - PLDM28: Sweet whey modified using a Nestlé patented procedure (cGMP removal). - FC concentrate: Growth factor concentrate, which is a high protein isolate (97% protein) extracted directly from skimmed milk and marketed by Tatua (Tatuani, New Zealand). Contains high levels of IGF and TGF. These fractions were administered to pups as isonitrogenous supplements (12% protein), such that the biological effect can be attributed to the qualitative content of the serum fraction rather than the amount of protein. The volume of the supplements was gradually adapted to accommodate the growth of the rat pups (150 pl/100 g body weight). Therefore, supplementation provided 1 to 5 mg of protein per day and per pup. The groups were the following: 1) CTRL-a: CTRL pups born from CTRL mothers, which received water supplementation. 2) RP-a: RP pups born from RP mothers, which received water supplementation. 3) RP-Lacprodan Di9224: RP pups born from RP mothers, which received a supplementation of Lacprodan Di9224. 4) RP-PLDM28: RP pups born to RP mothers, which received a PLDM28 supplementation. 6) RP- FC concentrate: RP pups born from RP mothers, who received a supplementation of FC concentrate. Two weeks after birth, at the time of sacrifice, the neuronal development of the pups was assessed using two methods: (I) a jejunal targeted gene expression profiling strategy, and (ii) measuring theex vivojejunal contractile response to a electrical field stimulation (ECE). The latter method measures the contractile response induced by the enteric nervous system and therefore the maturation and functional degree of the enteric nervous system. Theex vivocontractile response of the jejunum to acetylcholine was also evaluated, this measures the contractile response of the intestinal muscle itself, which therefore reflects the maturation and functional degree of the intestinal muscle. This latter experiment was performed as a control, to allow the inventors to separate the factors, ie, nervous system and muscle, by controlling the measured contractile responses. Ex vivocontractile response of the jejunum to electric field stimulation (ECE): To assess neuronal maturation in the protein restriction model and after supplementation with the sweet whey isolates of the invention, the contractile response of the jejunum to ECE was measured, which measures the involvement/capacity of the neural network to stimulate muscle contractility. The possible implication of any effect on intestinal muscle maturation due to protein restriction, or after supplementation with sweet whey isolates, was assessed by measuring the jejunal contractile response to acetylcholine. The contractile response of the jejunum to ECE was reduced in the RP-a group compared to the CTRL-a group, at the frequency of 10 Hz (P=0.040) (Figure 1). The jejunal contractile response to acetylcholine was slightly, but not significantly (P=0.181) reduced in the RP-α group compared to the CTRL-α group (Figure 2). Taken together, this reflects impaired neuromuscular interaction, and in particular impaired neuronal maturation, in the jejunum of protein-restricted pups. Supplementation with sweet whey fractions (Lacprodan Di9224 and PLDM28) significantly increased (P=0.007 and 0.026 respectively) the jejunal contractile response at 10 Hz to a level statistically similar to controls (Figure 1). This indicates a promoting effect of sweet whey fractions on neuronal stimulatory capacity in the jejunum, reflecting a promotion of neuronal development and function in the neonatal period. In fact, jejunal muscle compartment maturation was not significantly modified after supplementation with the sweet whey fraction (P=0.199 and 0.828 for Lacprodan Di9224 and PLDM28, respectively) since jejunal contractile responsiveness to acetylcholine remained unchanged compared to that of the PR-α group (Figure 2). Taken together, these data indicate that standard and modified sweet whey protein (Lacprodan Di9224 and PLDM28, respectively in the experiment) enhance the neural network-mediated muscle contractile response to electric field stimulation, ECE, in the jejunum of offspring of the RP group. This indicates that sweet whey protein promotes postnatal development and functionality of the enteric nervous system. Such a stimulatory effect was not observed in response to acetylcholine stimulation, suggesting that there is no enhancement of the smooth muscle contractile response in response to acetylcholine, ie, no promotion of postnatal smooth muscle maturation. Therefore, these data clearly show a beneficial effect of sweet whey protein in promoting neuronal development and function during the postnatal period. Based on these data, sweet whey constitutes a new nutritional solution to prevent or treat disorders associated with an immature and/or altered enteric nervous system in young mammals up to the age of approximately six years, in particular, during the neonatal period (usually defined as the first 6 six months of life, for a human being). Expression of genes involved in intestinal neuronal development: In the rat model experiment of Example 1, the effect of protein restriction, as well as protein restriction followed by supplementation with milk fraction, on the expression of major genes involved in biological pathways of neuronal development was studied, in the jejunum, using a gene expression profiling strategy. The genes studied are listed in Table 2 and the data is presented in Table 3. Data for unexpressed or misexpressed genes are not indicated. Among the remaining 35 genes expressed at a detectable level, in 18 of them (Table 3), a significant interaction between treatment (protein restriction) and complementation (dairy fractions) was observed. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed were those primarily involved in the maturation or differentiation of neurons and glial cells or were markers of neuronal growth and plasticity. The present inventors have previously shown (Cettour and Faure, manuscript in preparation) that compensatory mechanisms occur in protein-restricted (RP) pups to help promote cell and neuronal development in the small intestine. The present data confirm these findings. Specifically, the gene expression of neurotrophic factors and their receptors, such as NGF (Nerve Growth Factor),Gfra1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1), Graf2 (GDNF family receptor alpha 2), Ntg3 (Neutrophin 4), S100B (S100 calcium binding protein B), and synaptophysin, were significantly upregulated in the RP-a group, compared to the CTRL-a group. Possibly this reflects an imbalance and a ""stress"" situation in the animals, which nevertheless continues to be insufficient to promote neuronal maturation as indicated by our results after electric field stimulation (ECE). Lacprodan Di9224 supplementation significantly increased gene expression of NGF, NGFr (Nerve Growth Factor Receptor) and Chrm3 (muscarinic receptor 3) and decreased that of S100B to an expression level similar to that of CTRL-α (Table 3). The increased gene expression ofNGFrandnGf, together with the increased expression of NGF in the RP group, suggests the promotion of neuronal growth, development, and survival observed in Figure 1 [Tessarollo, (1998) Pleiotropic functions of neurotrophins in development . Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 9(2): 125-37]. It was observed that the levels of NGF and NGFr were increased in the RP-a group compared to those in the CTRL-a group, but that this increase was only significant for NGF. PLDM28 supplementation significantly increased gene expression of Crhr1, ApoE, NGFr, Ntf3 (neurotrophin 3), Chrm2 and 3 (muscarinic receptors 2 and 3), and TGFb2, and significantly decreased that of S100b. Again, increased gene expression of NGFr and Ntf3 may contribute to promoting neuronal growth and development and may, at least in part, explain the neuronal maturation observed in Figure 1. Muscarinic receptors such as those encoded by theChrm2andChrm3genes are involved in the contractility and motility of the intestinal musculature in response to Acetylcholine [Chen J, Wen J, Cai W. (2012) Smooth muscle adaptation and recovery of contractility after massive small bowel resection in rats. Exp Biol Med (Maywood). May 1; 237(5): 578-84]. Similarly, the corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crhr) receptor, also known as corticotropin-releasing factor, and apolipoprotein E, are involved in muscle contraction and motility pathways [Taché Y, Kiank C, Stengel A. (2009) A role for corticotropin releasing factor in functional gastrointestinal disorders Curr Gastroenterol Rep. Aug 11; (4):270-7;. Vincelette J, Martin-McNulty B, Vergona R, Sullivan ME, Wang YX, (2006) Reduced cardiac functional reserve in apolipoprotein E knockout mice Transl Res. Julio; 148(1):30-6.)]. After PLDM28 complementation, the expression of chrm3 and that of the aforementioned genes involved in muscle contractility pathways was significantly increased compared to that of RP-α. This might suggest promotion of intestinal muscle maturation, but this would warrant further attention as these increased gene expressions have not yet translated into measurable functional benefit as indicated by the unchanged contractility response to acetylcholine at pup sacrifice ( Figure 2). Supplementation with growth factor concentrate significantly increased Crhrl gene expression and significantly decreased that of GDFN, GFra1, Neurod1, S100b, and synaptophysin. Unlike PLDM28 and Lacprodan Di9224, there were no increased expression levels in the NGF pathway (nerve growth factor pathway) observed after supplementation with growth factor concentrate. This is consistent with the result that no beneficial effect on the neural network (ECE)-mediated contractile response of the jejunum (Figure 1) was observed after GF1 supplementation. The level of NGFr gene expression was significantly upregulated after complementation with either PLDM28 or Lacprodan Di9224, while the restriction protein-induced increased gene expression was maintained in these complemented groups. This clearly indicates stimulation of the NGF pathway. Neurotrophins, such as NGF, and their receptors, are expressed at a very high level in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Mouse gene targeting strategies have documented the role of neurotrophins in promoting developmental maturation of peripheral and central nervous system neurons, confirming their critical role in neuronal development. Reviewed in Tessarollo, L. (1998). NGF is also critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons. Without it, these neurons undergo apoptosis [Freeman RS et al., (2004) NGF deprivation-induced gene expression: after ten years, where do we stand? ""NGF and Related Molecules in Health and Disease"". Prog. Brain Res. Progress in Brain Research 146: 111-26]. Nerve growth factor causes axonal growth. This shows that NGF circulates throughout the body and that it is important to maintain homeostasis [Levi-Montalcini R (2004). “The nerve growth factor and the neuroscience chess board”. Prog. Brain Res. 146: 525-7.] Human and bovine milk also contain NGF activity suggested to play a role in the postnatal neurodevelopment and neuroprotection of the newborn [Gaull, G.E., Wright, C.E. & Isaacs, C.E. (1985). Significance of growth modulators in human milk. Pediatrics. 75:142-145]. The gene expression modifications observed in Table 3, and in particular the stimulation of the NGF pathway, likely contribute to the observed promotion of neuronal stimulatory responses to ECE in the PLDM28 and Lacprodan supplemented groups shown in Table 3. Figure 1. The populations that can benefit from the invention are: - Preterm, low (<2500 g), very low (>1500 g) and extremely low (<1000 g) birth weight babies; - Premature or full-term babies who have had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) that occurred after any adverse event during pregnancy; - Any neonate and infant showing delayed growth of the nervous system after, for example, hypoxaemia-ischaemia at birth or any other adverse event; - Any neonate and infant or child up to six years of age with gastrointestinal dysfunctions (digestive disorders, motility disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, slow gastrointestinal transit or oral food intolerance), Hirschsprung's disease and inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract (such as enterocolitis necrotizing) and pathologies related to obstruction. The invention is further described with reference to the following examples. It should be appreciated that the invention, as claimed, is not intended to be limited in any way to these examples. Example 1: Animal study (feeding and slaughter): Experiments on animals were carried out with authorization no. 2120 guaranteed by the Office Vétérinaire Cantonal, Etat de Vaud. Two-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained after one week of gestation in Harlan, Barcelona. On the day of arrival, the mother rats were housed in individual cages and randomly assigned to control (CTRL) or protein restriction (RP) groups. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Table 1 details the diets of the mothers of the CTRL and RP groups. The CTRL group mothers received a control diet containing 20 % protein (casein) adapted to the protein needs of standard rats during gestation (Reeves, P.G., Nielsen, F.H., Fahey, G.C., JR. 1993. AIN-93 Purified Diets for Laboratory Rodents: Final Report of the American Institute of Nutrition Ad Hoc Writing Committee on the Reformulation of the AIN-76A Rodent Diet. J. Nutr. 123: 1939-1951.). Mothers in the RT group received a RP diet containing 10% protein (casein). Both diets were isocaloric, balancing the protein deficit with the addition of corn starch. Table 1: Composition of control diet (CTRL) and protein restriction (RP) AIN-93G Subsistence allowance CTRL RP Components Corn starch 53 63 Casein (K Caseinate) 20 10 Sucrose 10 10 Soybean oil 7 7 Cellulose 5 5 AIN-93G mineral mix 4 -AIN-93M mineral mix - 4 AIN-93 Vitamin Blend 1 1 Choline Bitartrate 0.25 0.25 L-Cysteine 0.3 0.3 Tert-butylhydroquinone 0.0014 0.0014 The mothers of the CTRL and RP groups received their respective diets during pregnancy and lactation until the day of sacrifice (14 days after growth (14 DDN). Two NDD pups were randomly assigned to dams from the same experimental group and litter size was adjusted to 9 pups per dam with a minimum number of four to five males per litter. From 2 DNA to 14 DNA, a daily supplementation of water or one of the following milk fractions was manually/pipetted to the control or treated groups, respectively. The volume of the supplementations was gradually adapted to match the growth of the rat pups (150 pl/100 g body weight). The groups and diets were as follows: 1) CTRL-a: CTRL pups born from CTRL mothers, which received water supplementation. 2) RP-a: RP pups born from RP mothers, which received water supplementation. 3) RP-Lacprodan Di9224: RP pups born from RP mothers, which received a supplementation of Lacprodan Di9224. 4) RP-PLDM28: RP pups born to RP mothers, which received a PLDM28 supplementation. 5) RP - FC concentrate: RP pups born from RP mothers, which received a supplementation of FC concentrate. The milk fractions were: - Lacprodan Di9224: whey protein isolate, sweet whey, marketed by Arla Foods Ingredients, Denmark. - PLDM28: sweet whey modified using a Nestlé proprietary process (cGMP removal). - FC concentrate: Growth factor concentrate marketed by Tatua, New Zealand. Contains enriched levels of IGF (Insulin-like Growth Factor) and TGF (Transforming Growth Factor). Fourteen NDD, a maximum of 10 pups from the CTRL and RP groups, were weighed and then euthanized by decapitation after anesthetizing with halothane. The peritoneal cavity was opened by longitudinal incision of the abdominal wall and the entire digestive tract was removed and the mesentery was removed. The first third of the jejunal segment after Treitz ligation was isolated and divided into several segments. One segment was washed abundantly with PBS at room temperature and placed in cold Krebs solution forex vivo contractile response measurements.One segment was rinsed with ice-cold PBS to remove luminal material, transferred to individual cryotubes, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and held at -80°C until gene analysis. Neuronal development in the jejunum was assessed using two methods: (i) a targeted gene expression profiling approach and (ii) measuring theex vivojejunal contractile response to electric field stimulation (ECE). Ex vivocontractile response of the jejunum to electric field stimulation (ECE): Distal jejunum segments of approximately 1 cm in length, were placed in cold Krebs solution (CaCl2 (5 mM), MgCl2.6H2O (1.2 mM), NaCl (120 mM), NaH2PO4.H2O (1.2 mM) , NaHCOa (15.5 mM), KCl (5.9 mM), phenol red (0.005 mM), and glucose (11.5 mM)) pre-oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Intestinal segments were suspended along their longitudinal axis in a tissue bath (50 mL volume) loaded with 95% O2/5% CO2 oxygenated Krebs solution at 37°C. One end of the muscle was connected to a stationary clamp. The other end was connected by a rigid wire to an isometric force transducer. A stabilization period of 30 min was allowed to obtain spontaneous contractions. The tissue was then stretched to an initial length such that any further stretching would increase the tension at rest. Isometric contractility in the distal jejunum was induced with acetylcholine (10-5 M Ab) or with electric field stimulation (ECE, 5-10 Hz). The AC. was applied for 1 min. After completion of the dose response curve, the strips were tested with 80 mM KCl to ensure that their ability to contract was preserved. Signals were digitally recorded on a computer using Powerlab Chart 3.4. Results were normalized by cross-sectional area after carefully drying and weighing tissue fragments. Nonlinear fits were performed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, USA). To obtain the frequencies, an analysis of the power density spectra of the measured signal was performed. A high pass filter was applied, with a cutoff frequency of 2 Hz (much smaller than the Nyquist frequency of 100 Hz). Welch's method was used to calculate the power spectrum density with 1.3 seconds of overlap imposing a low-frequency discretization: a series of frequencies was defined between 0 and 2 Hz, equally separated by 0.05 Hz. The calculations of the power spectrum density were performed using the Goertzel algorithm. Three frequencies corresponding to the three highest power values below 2 Hz were chosen. Gene expression profile: Using the phenol/chloroform method with TriPure® reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted from the jejunum of RP and CTRL pups. Briefly, frozen tissue samples (50-100 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of TriPure® using the TissueLyser (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland). Using the RiboGreen RNA Quantification Kit (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the instructions provided in the kits, the quantity and quality of isolated RNA was measured. Using an oligo (dT15) primer (Promega, Madison, WI) and the ImProm-N™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, reverse transcription was performed with 1 µg of total Rn. T l 2: Li n n liz .  continuation  Expression levels of major genes involved in the development of the enteric nervous system (see Table 2) were assessed by quantitative, real-time, 2-step RT-PCR using the Sybergreen Profiler RT PCR microarray system (SABiosciences ). Measurements were performed in duplicate using specific sets of fluorescent TAMRA probes and primers during the log-linear phase of a PCR reaction with the Fas TaqMan 7600HT Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using Sequence Detection Software version 2.2. . PCR reactions were performed in 2 μl wells pre-loaded with the manufacturer's specific primers and probes in each of the 384 wells of the reaction plate. The reaction was performed using a final cDNA sample concentration of 0.8 ng/µL with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase enzymes (Applied Biosystems), nucleotides, and fluorescent dye. ROX used as a passive load reference. The sequences of the primers and probes used were designed and validated at Applied Biosystems and taken from the rat on-demand assay library. The relative expression level of each gene was normalized by means of the geometric mean of control genes (those whose expression was statistically stable in all experimental groups under our conditions).
