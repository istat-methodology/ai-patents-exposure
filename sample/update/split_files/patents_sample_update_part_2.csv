Generally, if the number of grid points is increased, the precision with which the color reproduction model is estimated rises but the time needed for measurement is prolonged because the number of colorimetric measurements is also increased. Accordingly, in a printer system comprising a pre-color-processing table for performing color matching and a post-color-processing table for performing color separation, color patches set non-equidistantly in RGB device color space are printed in accordance with changeover of printer CMYKcm signals in the post-color-processing table and the color reproduction model of the printer is generated using data obtained by measuring the colors of the color patches."

The system and method implement policies for facilitating optimal communications between communicating parties based on deterministic and/or uncertain preferences, capabilities and context, both present and predicted, where a decision to employ an initially selected channel and timing of communication may be overridden by contactor or contactee based on user-configurable triggers. The system and method further provide for mixed/multi-initiative overriding of the identified optimal communication channel and indicated best time for a communication. The methods can be implemented on a widescale communication system or within a single portable device. In one approach, the system attempts to optimize the inferred or directly accessed preferences of a contactee given the accessed or inferred preferences, capabilities and goals of the contactor while keeping the rationale and context of the contactee private. Such optimization can be achieved using preferences and policies concerning handling the attempted contact based on a deterministic specification or through inferring context, content and task under uncertainty by employing probabilistic or decision-theoretic inferences to attempt to maximize the expected utility of the communication to the contactee."
503,US-6913466-B2,System and methods for training a trainee to classify fundamental properties of media entities ,2001,"A system and methods are provided for training a trainee to analyze media, such as music, in order to recognize and assess the fundamental properties of any piece of media, such as a song or a segment of a song. The process includes an initial tutorial and a double grooving process. The tutorial phase exposes the trainee to a canonical set of classifications and then exposes the trainee to certain definitive song examples for each classification level of fundamental properties. The double grooving phase leverages the skills of the experts that defined the canonical set of classification terms to ensure that new listeners, even though exposed to the tutorial, appropriately recognize all fundamental musical properties. Thus, for specific song examples, a new listener matches results with the system experts within a degree of tolerance. When a high enough degree of cross-listening consensus is reached, the new listener becomes a groover and can classify new songs or segments of songs."

513,DE-60125327-T2,IMPLANTABLE SYSTEM FOR NEURAL MEASUREMENT AND NERVE STIMULATION ,2001,"AREA OF INVENTION The The present invention relates in its broadest concept to systems for electrically detecting signals that are biological Tissue go out, and for the subsequent selective stimulation of muscle or nerve tissue, wherein the systems are at least partially implantable. More accurate The present invention relates to the detection of nerve or muscle activity to which Analysis of signals and subsequent stimulation of nerves or muscle tissue on this basis. In a specific aspect The invention relates to the correction of a Spitzfußstellung based on these principles. BACKGROUND THE INVENTION For the human body There are numerous conditions under which a disease or a body dysfunction her Origin in the impaired Function of the neuromuscular system including defects the on an impaired Detection and motor activity are based. Hereinafter become the problems dealt with by the present invention discussed on the condition known as a hemiphlegic case foot is a condition in which a patient does not lift the foot during the walk, d. H. Dorsally inflect, which may normally be on an injury The upper motor nerve cells (UMNL) is based for the one Stroke and head injuries with reported frequencies of 12,000 / million for the stroke and 20,000 / million for head injuries by far the most common problems are. Law often People who have a stroke get one after another Treatment time a great Amount of functions again, but in approximately 10 to 20% of stroke survivors Upper Motor Nerve Cell Foot (UMN-DF) is a permanent long-term disability. The UMN-DF usually includes an inability the foot during the Vibration phase of the gait dorsal to inflect (Fallfuß), as well the loss of normal hip replacement and knee flexion, as well as inability to the 'repulsion' and a spasticity of the calf muscle group. One important feature of UMNLs is that the electrical excitability the associated peripheral nerve is still intact, indicating some of these Cases the Use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) for recovery or improving the gait. Already in 1961, Liberson and his staff beat the application electrical stimulation (ES) for the fibularis / peroneus communis to correct this condition while using a footswitch synchronized the application of the ES with the swing phase of the gear, using a device hereinafter referred to as a peroneal stimulator (PS) or as a fall foot stimulator (DFS) [Liberson W.T., Holmquest, H.J., Scott, D., and Dow, M., (1961) Functional Electrotherapy in Stimulation of the peroneal nerve synchronized with the swing phase of gait in hemiparetic patients. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 42, 202-205].  (i) Hardwired Single Channel Surface DFS: As indicated above, the first reported use of electrical stimulation for the correction of the hemiphlegic fall foot was by Liberson in 1961, who suggested that a dorsiflexion synchronized with the phase of the gait be obtained in a hemiphlegic foot. Liberson's solution in1shown included a power and control box (1), a heel switch (2), which, when opened, during the oscillation, the shunt resistance (3) and the supply of a stimulation current via the stimulation electrodes (4). When the switch is closed while standing, it connects the shunt resistor across the output of the stimulator, with no stimulus delivered to the stimulation electrodes. Thus, the delivery of the stimulus to the electrodes (positioned to stimulate the fibularis / peroneus communis) will be triggered when the heel switch opens when the heel lifts, while it is closed when the switch closes when the heel hits. Thus, the application of the stimulus is synchronized with the swing phase of the gait. This is an example of a hardwired stimulator where the functionality of the stimulator is determined by the wiring of the electronic circuitry. The system performed the essential task of introducing dorsiflexion in the subject's hemiphlegic foot to the correct point in the gait cycle. Indeed  the functionality of the system was clearly lacking in fineness, providing the stimuli in a crude manner compared to the natural function of the neuromuscular foot lifting system. (ii) Hardwired Multichannel Surface Falling Foot Stimulators: The first group, which is a big one technical innovation of the design presented by Liberson were Kralj and his staff from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. she suggested using multiple pacing channels in 1971 Fallfußstimulator and a radio link between the heel switch and the stimulator before [Kralj, A., Trnkoczy, A., and Acimovic, R., (1971) Improvement in Locomotion in Hemiplegic Patients with Multichannel Electrical Stimulation. In: Anonymous Human Locomotor Engineering - A review advances in prosthetics and the design of aids and controls, pp. 45-50. Institute of Mechanical engineers]. The proposed stimulator had three stimulation channels, the made it possible various muscle groups such as ankle dorsal flexors and knee flexors and extensors independently to control. (iii) Hardwired implanted single-channel fall-foot stimulators: The next major development in hemiphlegic foot-foot correction technology was the study of the possibilities and feasibility of implantable hemiphlegic foot-leg stimulators. Jeglic et al. Proposed an implanted DFS (IDFS) aimed at overcoming the problems of pains and difficulties experienced by the subjects in properly applying the pacing electrodes [Jeglic, A., Vanken, E., et al. Benedik, N., ""Implantable muscle / nerve stimulator as part of an electronic brace"", in Proc. 3rdInternational Symposium on External Control of Human Extremities, 1970, pp. 593-603]. The Single channel stimulation device from Jeglic u. a. was never successful, but can as a precursor the development of a commercial implantable fall foot stimulator by the group of Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center / University of Southern California in California in conjunction with Medtronic, Inc., of Minneapolis [Waters, R.L., McNeal, D., and Perry, J., (1975) Experimental Correction of Footdrop by Electrical Stimulation of the peroneal nerve. J. Bone Joint Surge [A] 57-A (8): 1047-1054]. The three elements of this system, which in2are an external module with a transmitting antenna and with a control module (10), an implanted assembly comprising a receiver, a pulse train generator and a bipolar electrode (11), and a heel counter (12), which is located in the shoe. Since the electric power was supplied by electromagnetic induction, the implanted device required no batteries, as well as the system of Jeglic et al. The antenna sent a radio frequency signal through the skin, which was taped to the skin directly above the implant. Two incisions were required: one at the mid aspect of the femur to implant the recipient, and another at the lateral aspect of the leg, below the knee, to expose the fibularis / peronealis communis. Probably because of the relatively extensive interventions the system was never brought to market. (iv) Microprocessor based surface and implanted fall foot stimulators: It Considers that the first use of microcontroller / microprocessor technology for DFS systems the integration of microprocessor technology into the previously discussed multichannel surface stimulators was. A Main motivation for the development of such multi-channel implantable stimulators was the overcoming the particular problem with implanted single channel systems, the from Waters u. a. [Waters, R.L., McNeal, D., Faloon, W., and Clifford, B., (1985) Functional Electrical Stimulation of the Peroneal Nerve for Hemiplegia - Long-Term Clinical Follow-up. J. Bone Joint Surg [A] 67-A (5): 792-793]. Waters u. a. featured found that some of the subjects receiving the implanted Medtronic single-channel DFS system was implanted after surgery with excessive inward rotation or outward rotation walked. This problem was a result of wrong positioning the electrodes, since the correct arrangement of the electrode during the Operation is difficult to determine. A balanced dorsiflexion response, if the subject is stretched, does not make sure that the same answer is obtained when the subject stands upright, carries a weight and runs. One solution to the problem of incorrect electrode placement during surgery and the tendency of the electrodes to move after surgery has been proposed by Kelih et al. [Kelih, B., Rozman, J., Stanic, U., and KLjajic, M. , (1988) Dual channel implantable stimulator. In: Wallinga, W., Boom, HBK, and deVries, J., (ed.) Electrophysiological Kinesiology, pp. 127-130. Elsevier Science Publishers BV (Biomedical Division)]. They proposed an implantable dual-channel stimulator that could control two degrees of freedom of foot movement, namely dorsiflexion and out  downward movement, allows. Thus, after surgery, when the subject began to walk using the implant, the stimulus level on each channel could be adjusted to provide balanced dorsiflexion. (v) Alternative sensors as replacement for the footswitches:  Out the reasons outlined Several researchers have evaluated alternative gait sensors, either an artificial one Use a gear sensor suitable for implantation or use the body's ""natural"" sensors. Now developments in these two research areas are discussed. (a) Artificial sensors as a replacement for the Foot switch: A the first groups, the alternatives to the footswitch as a gear sensor in DFS systems, Symons et al. a. at the Rancho lot Amigos Medical Center / at the USC [J. Symons, D. McNeal, R.L. Waters and J. Perry, ""Trigger switches for implantable gait stimulation "", in proc. 9th Annual RESNA Conference, 1986, p. 319]. Symons led one provisional Evaluation of an in-house accelerometer, which in a vertical orientation to the large trochanter process of the femur adjusted to capture the heel strike event. one The advantage of accelerometers is that they are miniaturized integrated electronic components and as such highly reliable and thus very suitable candidates for implantation are what the reasoning for the Evaluation of the accelerometer was. Willemsen et al. Of the University of Twente in the Netherlands proposed the use of an integrated accelerometer as a replacement for the footswitch in a UMN-DF correction system [Willemsen, ATM, Bloemhof, F., and Boom, HBK, (1990) Automatic Stance-Swing Phase Detection from Accelerometer Data for Peroneal Nerve Stimulation. IEEE Transactions Biomedical Engineering 37 (12): 1201-1206]. As in3In their paper on the lower leg of a subject, an array of four commercial single-axis accelerometers was arranged. Willemsen et al., Using the equivalent acceleration at the ankle, as calculated by four accelerometers, were able to do so at the locations30and31were able to distinguish between different phases of the gait cycle and were able to detect the onset of swing (lift off) and the completion of swing (heel strike). The failure rate of lift and heel impact detection has been carefully considered. Using three hemiphlegic subjects, there were only three steps out of a total of 106 steps, which is a very good performance. The U.S. Patent 5,814,093 discloses the use of such an artificial one Sensor, which is appropriately placed under the knee of a user is. As was customary in the past, were the (external) stimulation electrodes under the knee joint arranged. (b) ""Natural"" sensors as a replacement for the Foot switch: A very elegant and powerful solution to the problems of gear sensors in FES-ge  Supported UMN-DF correction systems is the use of the body's own detection mechanism. Haugland and Sinkjaer described the use of registrations from a cuff electrode on the suralis to direct the application of the stimulus to the fibularis / peronae communis of a hemiphlegic subject [Haugland, MK, and Sinkjaer, T., (1995) Cutaneous Whole Nerve Recordings Used for Correction for Footdrop in Hemiplegic Man. IEEE Transactions Biomedical Engineering 3 (4): 307-317]. In this essay, the preamble of claim 1. The device is in4shown and consisted of a power and control box40, from a lot of surface electrodes41for stimulation of the fibular / peroneal under the knee, from a nerve cuff electrode42around the suralis43implanted with percutaneous wires44that with a connector45could be connected to the power and control box. To reduce the noise in the nerve signal registration, there was an external reference electrode around the leg46strapped. The Suralis is a sensory nerve that uses as its sensor input touch sensors on the lateral part of the foot47has. It has been proposed to replace the conventional heel counter in a DFS system with a single suralis cuff, which monitored whether or not the affected foot supported weight, this information being used to control the application of the stimulus in the DFS. The registration of nerve signals is referred to as electroneurography, the corresponding signal being called an electroneurogram (ENG). Thus, it has been demonstrated that nerve registrations could be used as a basis for controlling a DFS, eliminating the need for an external footswitch and its associated problems. SUMMARY THE INVENTION  A or more of the above objects are first achieved by implantation of a Stimulation electrode proximal to the knee (preferably a multi-channel electrode), z. B. on the fibularis / peroneus communis, 5-10 cm proximal to the knee. This place offers one Number of advantages: more space for the stimulation device, less surgical intervention and better protection of the stimulation leads, who do not need to cross the knee joint (as it would, if the implanted electrodes via the knee would be arranged while the electrodes in the conventional Stimulation place are arranged under the knee), improved cosmetics and thus patient acceptance, since a corresponding external unit also over the knee and thus better except View can be arranged. This aspect is based on the knowledge that control the lower leg muscles through careful control the stimulation of a combined nerve, d. H. a nerve that a big Number of motor and sensory fibers that are covered much further proximally, than previously thought possible, achieved can be. Secondly For example, one or more of the above objects are achieved by a system in which Detection and stimulation electrodes arranged in a single location are (or can be arranged), which lies so that it can be used both as a nerve detection or (motor Detection) as well as nerve stimulation (or motor Stimulation) means is used. This aspect is based on the knowledge that individual peripheral nerves with ""useful"" combinations of Detection and motor fibers targeted localized and used can be. By the term ""individual Place ""is meant that the electrodes are close to each other at a single peripheral Nerve or at a single spinal cord nerve root a patient are arranged, wherein the single place by the single incision during is accessible to surgical implantation. It becomes a specific more useful Location for use in an HDP correction system but the concept has much wider access, because some kind of nerve signal (also a natural motor signal), which leads to the application of a stimulation nerve impulse (the can also be applied to a sensory nerve) can. A first example of an alternative use would be the creation of a nerve interface to an artificial prosthesis, and e.g. Based on the median, radial and / or ulnar nerve in the arm or sciatic nerve (or branches thereof, eg, the tibialis and the peroneal) in the leg. Efference signals are registered by one or more nerve stumps in the amputated limb. These signals are then used to determine the movement of the effects of the  To control the prosthesis. By properly transforming the signals into effects of the prosthesis, the control of the prosthesis can become as natural as the control of a normal limb. Furthermore, artificial sensors on the prosthesis relevant feedback information z. Force and position, which are then relayed back to the user by stimulating the afferent fibers in the nerve stumps. In this way, the user can receive from the prosthesis a sensation that feels as if it came from the amputee limb. One A second example of an alternative use would be to provide bladder control Patients with detrusor reflex enhancement, such as spinal cord injury, in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's patients z. B. on the Foundation of sacral spinal nerve roots. There are implantable stimulators to control emptying Subjects with spinal cord injury, wherein but these systems have no means to detect when the Bubble is full and must be emptied. Further, they can not the involuntary reflex transferred Detect bladder contractions that are commonly experienced by the same patients. This involuntary Contractions often lead to Incontinence and effective to a very small bladder capacity. To this To avoid, the sensor parts of the nerve roots are considered part the procedure of implantation of a void control stimulator often cut off. For a combined pacing and registration electrode would it be possible, the bladder fullness as well as to capture the reflex contractions of these nerve roots. As it is possible is the bladder emptying z. B. by stimulation of the pudendal, allows the availability of information about the onset of reflex contractions to stop them. The procedure of registering the natural Nerve activity, while could be stimulated at the same time, it could thus To avoid incontinence without cutting off the roots of sensory nerves, during the Users can be informed at the same time when the bubble is full is. One third example of an alternative use would be in an artificial continence opening applied. The artificial opening can z. B. by tapping a muscle from its normal anatomical Place and its reconfiguring be formed as a sphincter. It An electrical nerve stimulation is used to stimulate the muscle contract and thus close the artificial opening. Because when using striped muscles to produce a constant force over a long period of time the fatigue One problem is it's important to keep the stimulation to the minimum required to reduce. Immediately after emptying of the intestine can the stimulation intensity be low. However, extended the muscle and begins to open, if nothing happens when the pressure in the intestine is greater than that stimulated by the Muscle-generated pressure becomes what leads to incontinence. There as the new sphincter used muscle contains muscle spindles, it is possible the activity of them to register by means of the same electrode as they for the Activation of the motor fibers is used. The initial extension of the muscle can be detected and used by the spindle activity to cause the stimulation intensity to increase. In this way becomes the sphincter kept closed with minimal muscle power at all times, what the fatigue reduced. Because the stimulation intensity is now the pressure in the Intestine monitors, is it also possible to provide the system with an alarm telling the user when it's time to empty the bowel. One Fourth example of an alternative use would be the ""amplification"" of a nerve signal for enhancement a muscle contraction or to improve the perception. One weak nervous signal registered by a nerve can through proper transformation can be used to stimulus to control the same nerve that naturally occurs in the nerve activity come in addition. This can be either by stimulating more nerve fibers are already active, or by being already active Nerve fibers with higher frequency be stimulated (or by both). In this way can be too weak arbitrary Muscle contraction can be translated into a strong and functional movement. this could z. B. at the fibularis / peronaeus Stroke patients who have a reduced (rather than a complete lack) arbitrary Drive for the foot dorsal flexor muscles or at the soleus or LGS nerves in the same patients, around the contraction of the ankle-plantarflexor muscles to increase, around the ""kick-off"" phase of running to be applied. Applied to sensory nerves can reduce the perception of patients with decreased perception of a part of the body elevated become. A fifth example of an alternative use would be to perform a controlled reduction in activity in a nerve. A nerve cuff electrode can be used to generate in a nerve simple opposing action potentials, which by a collision block stops the naturally occurring activity in the nerve. One method of controlling the level of blocking is to monitor the activity passing through the blocking electrode while using the same electrode to generate the blocking potentials. In this way, a feedback algorithm can be created to  regulate the level of stimulation to regulate the natural activity that is allowed to pass through the electrode and on to the innervated organ or muscle. A practical application of this could be the regulation of activity in the autonomic nerves that innervate the heart (the vagus heart and sympathetic heart nerves) under pathological (cardiac) conditions. One sixth example of alternative use would be prevention involuntarily spastic Skeletal muscle contractions. There will be efference signals from one or registered by several nerves affecting the spastic muscles innervate. When at times the user wants to the muscles are relaxed, eferenced nerve signals are registered, These nervous signals are used to be a simple one opposite stimulation pattern to activate, through a collision block of nerve action potentials prevents the efferent nerve signals from reaching the muscles, and thereby prevent or halt a spastic muscle contraction. According to the invention discloses a device for creating a dorsiflexion of the foot of a patient The device comprises: a combined detection and stimulation electrode apparatus comprising at least one neuro-sensor electrode means which detects a nerve signal from a peripheral nerve can, and at least one stimulation electrode means comprising a can stimulate peripheral motor nerve fiber, means to the to detect and process detected nerve signals To identify a signal that indicates a specific effect, the is a component of the gait performed by the patient, and in Response to generating a control signal, and means for at least one stimulation electrode means in response to the Control signal to operate so that there is a stimulation of the peripheral generated motor nerve fiber. The at least one neurosensor electrode means and the at least one Stimulation electrode means are not as separate electrodes provided but combined in a combined electrode, further comprising means for surrounding each combined electrode between a neuro-sensor electrode state and a stimulation-electrode state switch. In this way, the ""most compact"" implementation involves a device according to the invention a single combined electrode (which is actually normally through a pair of electrode leads would be shown) in combination with corresponding ones Switching means. As is visible from the above disclosure of the prior art, it is common desired, several To provide electrodes in a multi-channel construction, this an improved control of both the detection and stimulation aspects the given implementation creates. However, all the more More conductors are used to send signals between the electrodes and to transmit to the processing means, the more channels present, leading to the scope of the implanted device as well susceptibility contributes. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention means provided that allow that compared to the number of electrodes a reduced number of Conductors are used by the signals preferably serially coded transmitted and the appropriate means for encoding and decoding the signals are provided.

How out5As can be seen, the system comprises an implantable multi-channel stimulator with a multi-pole nerve stimulation electrode that can be implanted on the fibular / peroneal nerve. Further, it has an external unit that powers and controls the implant based on an external switch located under the heel of the user. The heel switch causes the stimulation to be turned on during the gait during the swinging phase of the affected leg and turned off during the stance phase to cause the dorsiflexor muscles to actively lift the foot off the floor during the swing and relax the dorsiflexor muscles during standing. Fibularis / Peronaeus (implantation site for the Stimulation electrode)  Further this place has the electrode opposite places under the knee (the previously used) have the advantage that the lead wires to a suitable Place for the main body of the implant, z. In the upper thigh or in the abdomen, guided can be without having to cross the knee joint. This reduces the risk of line breakage. multipolar Nerve stimulation electrode The Stimulation electrode can have many different constructions. The common feature is that they have multiple electrical contacts should be located either within or in the immediate vicinity of stimulating nerve are arranged. The contacts should be arranged like this be that different parts of the nerve are activated when electrical Electricity is passed through it. In a preferred embodiment a nerve cuff electrode is used, which in principle is a tube of an insulating material (such as silicone) of a number the inside of the tube arranged metal contacts (such as platinum, Platinum / iridium or stainless steel). The tube is on one side open, to enable that it is mounted around the nerve, using a locking mechanism is used to subsequently close the cuff. In a preferred embodiment, a silicone cuff is used with 12 platinum electrode contacts arranged as four tripoles in the cuff. The external contacts of each tripole are shorted to a wire located in the cuff wall, leaving only eight wires to leave the cuff. In a preferred embodiment, the cuff is about 20 mm long and has an inside diameter that is approximately 20% larger than the nerve (typically 5.2 mm). In tests it has been shown that this type of electrode ensures enough selectivity in the stimulation to be sufficient  to have control of the foot movement for the rehabilitation of a Spitzfußstellung. implanted Mehrkanalstimulator In a first embodiment the stimulator is located on a separate housing and is by means of a multi-wire cable with the stimulation electrode connected. The cable has an in-line connector which during the Operation can be assembled to allow the wires to pass through to relieve the skin. Of the Purpose of the stimulator is to supply electrical impulses to the Contacts in the stimulation electrode. Usually, these pulses are charge balanced and current-controlled pulses to about electrochemical processes minimize the electrode site and thereby the risk of damage reduce the electrodes and the surrounding tissue. The stimulator will over a coupling loop through the skin powered and controlled. Of the Stimulator can be implemented in several ways. The stimulator may be analogous, having separate channels, each with a separate coupling loop, with its own frequency In a two-channel system, this could be 1.1 MHz or 4.4 MHz), be powered and controlled. The device is implanted in a small number of patients and by this patient on a daily basis used. This stimulator generates two-phase pulses fixed current, which are pulse-ready modulated by the external transmitter. A further implementation of the stimulator could be such by means of digital Be electronics. This procedure is strongly to be preferred, as it allows about the Coupling loop to build a serial communication channel and to program many more stimulation parameters in this way. Furthermore only a single coupling loop is necessary to any number of channels to support. at the implant system as described above remains a problem: everyone Contact in the electrode requires a separate conductor in that Cable (unless some contacts are directly in the electrode connected). if desired is, many stimulation channels To use the cable between the stimulator and the electrode very thick, which is very impractical and more prone to movement damaged as well as increases the risk of damage to the nerve on which the electrode is arranged. A solution therefor is to place a portion of the stimulator directly to the electrode. He could then be made so that the cable is power only and serially coded Information from the main body to transfer to the electrode needs. This information is then decoded at the electrode and Stimulation pulses distributed to one or more of the contacts. In this way, the number of conductors in the cable can be anywhere be reduced between two and four. This solution requires that the electrode part of the circuit is extremely miniaturized otherwise it will not fit the electrode. Kind of, this is to do it as a custom integrated circuit to implement. Of the The above aspect of serial coding of information concerns also versions, in which, as will be described below, both for detecting as well as to stimulate multiple channels. In a such embodiment The part of the implanted electrodes should be means for serial Encoding the detected signals for subsequent transmission to the processing means and corresponding means for decoding serially coded signals transmitted by the stimulator will include. power and stimulus control transmitter On the surface The skin can / can be over one implanted portion of the device one or more coils to transfer of power and control information to the implant be. The coils are equipped with a device with batteries, with a Control circuitry and with a power amplifier for Power supply of the coupling loop connected. These Unity can be constructed in different ways. In a specific embodiment it has been implemented with a microcontroller that has a Program for the communication with the implant stores and the parameters for the Stimulation stores. The unit has inputs for the power of a battery, for a Signal from a heel switch and for a serial input channel for the Programming pacing parameters into the unit. Further she has a connector for downloading a new program in the unit. radio receiver Of the radio receiver is optional, but facilitates the programming of parameters from the programming unit into the device and allows As will be described below, a wireless heel switch to have. One Receiver, built by the inventors was based on one of the miniature transceiver circuits, those commercially available in those years (eg, from RF Monolithics, Inc.) available become. It provides a digital signal to the serial input at the power and stimulus control unit, replacing simply a standard RS-232 cable. programming unit with radio transmitter Around the system for Setting up a specific patient is a programming unit necessary. This can either be a dedicated hand unit or a PC with a suitable program. If the performance and Stimulus control unit is equipped with a radio receiver should the programming unit has a corresponding transmitter to to enable that stimulus parameters without wires transmitted to the power and stimulus control unit.  The Recording a gradual increase / decrease is important for many the patient, because the simple sudden on and off stimulation frequently causes the ankle plantarflexor to or ankle dorsiflexor muscles triggered a stretch reflex becomes. The reflex is caused by too fast movement of the joint and always works the desired Move against. The choice of a suitable speed of the gradual Rise / fall for each of the activated channels can eliminate this reflex. In a present embodiment becomes the stimulation intensity while the swing phase of the leg (after the gradual increase on the specified Level) kept constant while it is in a future embodiment prove useful can, the strength while the swing phase as well as for change a short period of time after foot-to-floor contact. If the stimulation intensity during a Part of the oscillation phase is reduced, potential fatigue and Complaints of stimulation can be reduced. Furthermore, it may be useful the stimulation intensity for one short time after the heel has touched the ground to increase to the mechanical effects of the reaction force of the soil, the upward on the heel acts to counteract that cause can make the front part of the foot faster than the user preferably comes down. apart from the ""advanced"" programming unit can for the patients are provided with a box that is inside a limited range set by the therapist simple way (eg with a rotary knob or with a slider) the stimulation intensity and / or the balance between turning inwards and turning away can adjust. This user interface may be good many or all set the stimulation parameter, but the user only one or two buttons should have to adjust. An intelligent routine in the programming unit provides then on the basis of the user command the specific parameters. Heel switch with / without radio transmitter In the first preferred embodiment the stimulation is controlled by a sensor that is in the shoe of the User is arranged. This sensor can be a standard heel switch be that with a cable with the power and stimulus control unit is connected, or may be another type of sensor, the information about the Foot-ground contact gives. Further, the cable may be through a wireless communication link be replaced. In this first preferred embodiment, the switching means has been implemented as a wearable garment attached to the user's ankle. At a location under the heel, an ultrathin sensor (in this case a force sensitive resistor from Interlink Electronics, Inc.) is sewn into the garment. This sensor could also be made of a piezoelectric thin film, which has the advantage that it can provide power for parts of the electronic circuit or for the entire electronic circuit in the device. The garment has a compact unit over the ankle containing a battery, a transmitter (from RF Monolithics, Inc.) and a standard microcontroller. Normally, the microcontroller is in a ""sleep mode"" in which it consumes very little energy. When the user either steps on the sensor or releases the weight from it, the controller wakes up, sends an identification number (to avoid interference with other, similar systems in the area), and then sends one of two possible codes (one for heel strike and one one for heel lift) to the power and stimulus control unit and then returns to sleep. The combination of a portable garment with the sewn-in device, wireless communication with the power and control box, and the fact that the sensor is very thin made it possible  It is clear that the user wears it all day long, even when changing clothes and footwear to choose virtually any type of footwear and go even without shoes. EXAMPLE 1 Three hemiphlegic patients were equipped with the above first embodiment. It was examined whether the system could produce dorsiflexion and whether the multi-channel stimulation electrode placed on the fibular / peroneal above the knee could ensure good selectivity to control the various foot movements. By properly balancing the different stimulation channels, it was possible to create a foot movement that was almost pure dorsiflexion, which is the natural movement and thus cosmetically most acceptable and least damaging to the ankle during the gait.7Figure 11 shows an example of the torques measured about the ankle of a human subject with a 12-pole nerve cuff electrode implanted near the fibularis / peroneus near the knee. The foot was fixed during the measurements and the isometric torques generated around the ankle were registered while the stimulation intensity was increased from zero to maximum over a period of 5 seconds (pulse width 0-250 μs, current 1 mA, frequency 20 Hz). In7It can be seen that the effect of the stimulation on the different channels was quite different, which shows a good selectivity of the cuff electrode and shows that the nerve fibers in the nerve bundle were functionally organized. Channel A for low pacing levels produced a combination of dorsiflexion and inward rotation that changed at high pacing levels for outward rotation. Channel B produced a combination of dorsiflexion and outward rotation. Channels C and D produced a combination of outward rotation and plantar flexion for low levels that changed for higher levels for dorsiflexion. During gait, relatively low torques are required to produce motion, and by selecting a combination of the strengths in the different channels (in this case, by combining channel 1 and 2), it was possible to produce a natural dorsiflexion of the foot. which felt comfortable for the patient. Based on8thA second embodiment will now be described, which does not form part of the invention, but is useful for understanding the invention. Compared to the in5As shown, the heel counter in this system has been replaced by a system for utilizing the natural activity of sensory nerves registered by a peripheral nerve going to the foot. Since many of the parts for the second embodiment are the same as those for the first embodiment, only the parts in FIG8ththat are different from those in5are described. sensory Nerve of the foot The Nerve information about the foot-to-floor contact are found in several of the nerves that innervate the foot skin. It can be expected that the best source of such signals is the Are nerves that innervate the plantar surface. Indeed The inventors have also found that nerves affect other areas of the foot innervate, provide enough information that they are taken and for the control of the stimulator can be used. signals from the heel bone branch of the tibialis (which innervates the skin on the heel) have been registered by being just proximal to the ankle joint a nerve cuff electrode has been implanted on it [Upshaw and Sinkjaer (1998) Digital signal processing algorithms for the detection of afferent nerve activity recorded from cuff electrodes, IEEE Trans. Rehabilitation Engineering, Vol. 6, No. 2, 172-181]. This gives a good signal, but with surgical access to the nerve For this Nerve too difficult to be a good candidate for a commercial system to be. Of the Suralis is a better candidate because of surgical access to it is much easier for him. Furthermore he gives a signal that is as good as that of the heel bone nerve has been registered. Both signals clearly modulate with the Gait cycle, and it is possible from these signals the heel impact and in most cases also to capture the heel lift. To the Suralis can easily few Centimeters proximal to the outer malleolus, where he is immediately under the skin, access to be obtained. For surgical reasons, it is even better if the signals can be registered much further proximal, preferably proximal to the knee. This may be possible because a branch of the fibularis / peroneus communis is in contact with the suralis (Suralis junction branch (67)). This branch is found immediately adjacent to the site where the stimulation electrode is implanted, that is, the registration electrode can be implanted through the same surgical incision. Registration nerve electrode The nerve registration electrode can be constructed in several ways. The common feature is that they have one or more electri  having contacts arranged in or around the nerve such that the naturally occurring activity can be registered either as the sum of the activity on all nerve fibers or as the sum of the activity of a portion of the nerve fibers or as the activity of a single nerve fiber. In a preferred embodiment a nerve cuff electrode has been chosen, in principle a tube of an insulating material (such as silicone) with a Number of arranged on the inside of the tube metal contacts. The tube is open on one side, to enable that it is mounted around the nerve, using a locking mechanism is used to subsequently close the cuff. Of the Nerve cuff of the inventor has three inner circumferential electrodes (made of platinum or stainless steel), which are symmetrical in the cuff (one in the middle and one at each end) are. Furthermore it has an external electrode on the outside of the cuff is arranged and used as a reference. The A method of registering nerve activity with such an electrode has been described in the literature. It provides a signal that a weighted sum of activity in all nerve fibers in The cuff is and gives a good suppression of noise outside of the cuff. Furthermore is in chronic implants both in animals and in humans been shown that it over long periods gives stable signals. implanted amplifier and implanted telemetry device Of the Purpose of this unit is the reinforcement of the with the registration electrode registered nerve signal and its transmission through the skin to the external nerve signal receiver. Depending on the type of registration electrode, it can be different Be implemented. You should get the signal from the registration electrode reinforce with an appropriate amount and optionally a certain amount Signal conditioning (such as bandpass filtering, rectification and / or Integration), before sending the signal through the skin. In a specific embodiment this is implemented with a standard instrumentation amplifier which has the signal approximating 120 dB amplified and transmits the signal through frequency modulation of the carrier signal via a coupling loop. It has a bandwidth of 10 kHz. He is using a separate coupling loop powered by the external power transmitter and signal receiver. The two coupling loops send signals through the same space and are decoupled by a technique known as morphognostic coils. In short, this technique relies on the coils being shaped like this are that the summed magnetic flux from a coupling loop, the goes through the coils of the other, is zero. This is done by that the coils of the power loop are square shaped, while the coils of the signal loop are shaped like an 8. Continue to work the two loops with separate frequencies. power stations and signal receiver These Unit forms the external part for the implanted amplifier and for the implanted telemetry device. It represents an oscillating magnetic field from which the implant gets its performance, and it receives from the magnetic field that transmits the amplified nerve signal to the implant. This latter magnetic field is absorbed by a coil that adapted to the implanted transmitter coil, the resulting electrical signal is demodulated to extract the nerve signal. signal analysis Of the The purpose of the signal analysis unit is the transmission of the registered Nerve signal into a signal that simulates that of a heel switch, if this would have been arranged in the user's shoe. This can be implemented in different ways. Most successful is the following to this day. preprocessing: To remove artifacts caused by electromyographic signals (EMG) from nearby muscles, and the contents of electrode and amplifier noise To reduce the nerve signal is bandpass filtered. The filter cutoff frequencies be based on the optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio using signals with known contents to signal and Noise selected. Then the signal is rectified and integrated. To the takes place from the stimulation pulses coming artefacts takes place the integration between the stimulation pulses in sections in such a way that the integrated sections those times, exclude pacing artefacts. This is a box integration called technique. The resulting signal has a much lower bandwidth than the original one Nerve signal and represents the average amplitude of the nerve signal between each Stimulation pulse. This processing can be done either with an analogue or with a digital circuit arrangement. In any Case, the signal must be in a digitized format from preprocessing come. Foot-to-floor contact detection: The digitized preprocessed nerve signal is fed to an adaptive logic network (ALN, available from Dendronic Decisions, Ltd.), which is a type of  artificial neural network. This type of network is described in the literature and consists of a number of so-called linear threshold units and a number of logic nodes. Because of the logic of the network, it is very easy to implement in a portable device such as the microcontroller described above. The network takes as input a number of parameters derived from the preprocessed nerve signal and produces as output a signal that can be used to turn the stimulator on and off. The network is trained by a supervised learning technique that requires the sequence of data to be registered by the patient during the walk. During this episode, the patient is equipped with sensors under the foot. A lot of data is passed to the ALN with the corresponding nerve signal and sensor signal, and the training algorithm optimizes the network to generate an output signal from the nerve signal that matches the registered sensor signal. When this is done, the artificial sensors under the foot can be removed, with the ALN controlling the stimulator solely on the basis of the nerve signal. If registrations are made from more than one nerve (eg from the tibialis and from the suralis or from the suralis junction branch), it is possible to gather information about how the foot lands on the floor, e.g. For example, whether it lands on the lateral or on the middle aspect of the sole of the foot, because of different branches of the tibialis compared to the suralis47other areas of the sole of the foot (lateral branch48, Heelbone branches49and middle branch50, please refer4innervate). This information can then be used to automatically regulate the relative stimulation levels to correct for excessive inward rotation or outward rotation of the foot. Similarly, stimulation levels may be increased to provide better dorsiflexion to cause the foot to land first with the heel if it is detected that the foot first lands with the front. Based on9Now, a third embodiment in accordance with the invention will be described. This system combines the stimulation and registration electrodes in one. This significantly reduces the amount of operation to be performed and reduces the complexity of the implant. This can be done because the fibularis / peroneal contains skin fibers (sensory fibers) that go to the foot, and since it has been proven that it is possible to register information from these sensors with the nerve cuff stimulation electrode described above. The registered signal clearly modulates with the gait cycle and can be translated into a stimulator control signal in the same manner as described in the second preferred embodiment. Compared to those in the5and8thAs shown, most of this third system is the same except that the sensor electrode and its cable are missing and that the amplifier and stimulator are built into the same device. As a result, the external equipment is simplified because only one power sensor is necessary. Multipole nerve stimulation and registration electrode These Electrode can be constructed in several ways. Indeed the design must meet both the requirements for the registration electrode as well as for fulfill the stimulation electrode. The same as in the second embodiment described multipolar nerve cuff is suitable for this purpose. Implanted multichannel stimulator and nerve signal amplifier These Unity can be implemented in several ways. Basically it's just a combination of the stimulator and the amp, based on of the first and second embodiments have been. However, it necessarily has a switch arrangement, the electrode between either with the stimulator or with the amplifier can switch connected. Preferably This unit should contain the pre-processing as above with respect to the second embodiment as this is the necessary bandwidth for the implanted Transmitter greatly reduced. If the stimulator with digital electronics is implemented, it allows be, information about to store the parameters of pre-processing, so that these the specific conditions of the particular patient, the particular Nerve, the special electrode, etc. can be adjusted. Besides that is it then possible send out the signal in digital form and thereby the effect the loss of signal quality in the transmission through the skin. In addition, with the stimulator and the amplifier connected in this way, it is possible to send further information from the implant to the external unit via the same coupling loop as it transmits the amplitude of the nerve signal. This information could be z. B. impedance measurements of the electrodes (to check their integrity), information about the humidity in the enclosure (to warn of a potential malfunction of the device), information on the coupling coefficients between the  external and implanted coils (to facilitate the placement of the external unit), information about communication errors (acknowledgment exchange), etc. If selective registrations of the different amounts of electrodes in the electrode assembly, it is possible to obtain information about that to grasp how the foot is on the Ground lands, z. B. whether he is on the lateral or middle aspect the sole of the foot lands. This information can then for used automatic regulation of relative stimulation levels be an excessive inward rotation or outward turn of the foot to correct. Similar can the stimulation levels be increased if it is determined that the foot with the front part first lands, allowing a better dorsiflexion is obtained to cause the foot to land first with the heel. EXAMPLE 2 As described below, the inventors have demonstrated a dermal nerve signal from the foot using it Electrode, as for the stimulation of the nerve for the dorsiflexion of the foot was registered by the fibularis / peroneal nerve proximal to the knee can. Furthermore it has been proven that it is possible to use this signal simultaneously to register while stimulated by the same cuff. method When Part of the procedure for the exam the implantable equiniposition stimulator developed by the inventors Three hemiphlegic patients were present at the fibularis / peroneus communis a few inches proximal to the knee with a 12-pole nerve cuff electrode (20 mm long, 5.2 mm ID) instrumented. The eight lead wires to the Electrodes were used for an 8 week start period taken from the skin. This procedure enabled in this initial period a direct electrical access to the cuff. One of the patients (female, 32 years old) also had a nerve cuff located on the suralis proximal to the ankle and an implantable enhancer placed subcutaneously in the mid-thigh10that the sciatic nerve100, the Suralis101, the fibularis / peroneus102, the implanted amplifier103for strengthening the suralis signal, the suralis cuff electrode104, the fibular / peroneal cuff electrode105and the percutaneous wires106from the fibularis / peroneal cuff electrode. To enable it to register and pace through the same cuff electrode, an electronic circuit was built, see11coming from a personal computer110, from a stimulator111, from an optically coupled field effect transistor112, from the electrode113, from an amplifier114which amplifies the signal via a Fermessungsverbindung115to a corresponding recipient116sent, and from a bandpass filter117which filtered the signal to between 600 Hz to 2500 Hz. While a pulse was being delivered to the amplifier in the intervals between pulses, the circuit switched the electrodes to the stimulator through an output from the stimulator118controlled by. The switches were fabricated by optically coupled field effect transistors because they produced very little switching noise (no charge injection through a gate capacitance). In addition, they had no galvanic connection between the switched signal and the control signal, which caused them to have very little effect on the common mode rejection characteristics of the amplifier. A more conventional way to achieve this would be to use transformer coupling, but transformers are inherently bulky and would be difficult to use in an implantable device. The stimulator generated charge-balanced current-controlled pulses (1 mA, 0-255 μs pulse width). The PC controlled the stimulator and felt the amplified nerve signal and processed it. Of course, the embodiment described above is merely a laboratory test model that would be miniaturized for subsequent implementation by incorporating the receiving and filtering means, the computing means, and the stimulator into a small and lightweight device that could easily be e.g. B. attached to the upper arm of a patient or can be worn in a belt. Furthermore, the stimulation signals and the power would be used to drive the electrodes113and thus the associated circuitry using a Fermessungsverbindung, as between the amplifier114and the receiver116shown is also supplied to the implanted part of the system. Furthermore, the circuit arrangement can the electrodes113and the external components of the system for encoding and decoding the signals as described above. 12shows an example of the raw signal that has been registered during stimulation. The combined stimulation artifacts and switching noise lasted short enough (10 ms) to allow a sufficiently long window between them to register the nerve signal. 13shows data registered by the fibularis / peroneal nerve cuff during gait (without stimulation). The upper signal track  is the rectified and box-integrated suralis signal130which is included for comparison only. The second signal track is the corresponding fibularis / peroneus signal131, For reference, the ankle angle132(registered by a Penny & Giles goniometer) and signals registered by force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) under the foot on the heel134and at the middle135and lateral133Metatarsus were shown. It is clear that the Fibularis / Peronäus signal modulated synchronously with the gait cycle and had similar features to the Suralis signal. It was then investigated whether the signal processing algorithm could be applied to the decoupling of a stimulator control signal to the Fibularis / Peronus signal based on an Adaptive Logic Network (ALN). This type of network is described in the literature and consists of a number of so-called linear threshold units and of a number of logic nodes [A. Kostov, BJ Andrews, DB Popovic, RB Stein, WW Armstrong (1995) Machine learning in control of functional electrical stimulation systems for locomotion IEEE Trans. Biomedical Engineering, Vol. 42, No. 6, pp. 541-551]. Because of the logic nature of the network, it is very easy to implement in a portable device such as the microcontroller described above. The last signal track136in13shows the result of it. The network was trained at 50 seconds level walking and rated at a further 50 seconds level walking. The comparison of the target signal received from the FSR with the output of the ALN provided correct samples as high as those obtained using the Suralissignals. 14shows results from the simultaneous stimulation and registration of the same cuff. The subject sat down. In the11The circuit shown was connected to a set of electrodes in the fibularis / peroneal cuff. The first row140shows the stimulation intensity (pulse width in microseconds, current = 1 mA, frequency = 25 Hz). The second row141shows the output from a force sensor (uncalibrated) held by hand to the back of the foot to give an indication of the effect of the stimulation. The third row142shows the rectified and box-integrated fibularis / peroneal signal (in microvolts). The fourth row143shows a touch sensor (uncalibrated) that was used to manually pace the skin to give an indication of when sensor signals should be expected. The data in the first column144were registered when there was no stimulation and no skin contact. Thus, the registered signal represented the background activity of the system. In the second column145The foot was touched in the skin innervation area of the fibularis / peroneal, modulating the registered nerve signal accordingly. In the third column146Stimulation was applied by the cuff, but the skin was not touched. This gave a small increase in the nerve signal corresponding to the toe movement caused by the change in stimulation intensity, but no apparent change that could be directly linked to the stimulation artifacts. In the fourth column147The fibularis / peroneal was stimulated by the cuff and touched the skin. It can be seen that it was still possible to obtain from the nerve a clear nerve signal that modulated in agreement with the skin, even when the same nerve was stimulated with the same electrode. Conclusions It it has been proven that it is possible to have a peripheral Nerve to stimulate and over a single set of electrodes that multiplexes fast enough to be functional at the same time, natural sensor information to register from this nerve. This can be done in a number of applications, where a natural Sensor feedback Adding power to a nerve prosthesis can be very useful. Further it has been proven that it is possible to provide gear-related information from the fibularis / peroneus over the Knee register and use to send a control signal generate a fibularis / peroneal stimulator for the Correction of a Spitzfußstellung to control."

The dielectric material is determined to be in a state, S, by determining a similarity or dissimilarity between: (a) a first set of impedance values derived from excitation of a capacitor having the dielectric material disposed between electrodes for the capacitor, and (b) a second set of predetermined corresponding impedance values indicative of the state S. For each of a plurality of electrical frequencies, there are corresponding impedance values in the first and second sets. Each such impedance values is one of a conductance and a capacitance value for the dielectric material. Thus, within a time period sufficiently short so that the dielectric material is expected to remain in a same state throughout the time period, each of the electrical frequencies is used to excite the capacitor, and corresponding response impedance values are derived that provide an impedance “snap shot” of the dielectric material. Accordingly, a most likely state for the dielectric material is determined from a similarity or dissimilarity between the snap shot (i.e. the first set hereinabove), and the second of predetermined corresponding impedance values for the state."

533,DE-60210477-T2,COMMON-USED DATA PROCESSING FOR PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS ,2001,"AREA OF INVENTION The The present invention relates generally to process control systems in Process or processing plants and in particular a data processing system, Internet-based communications uses data processing and computing control options for one To provide variety of processing plants. DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART Process control systems like those in chemical, petroleum or other processing plants typically have one or more centralized or decentralized process control units, those with at least one host or server workstation and with one or more process control and instrumentation devices such as field devices Analog, digital or combined analogue / digital buses communicative are coupled. Field devices, such as valves, valve positioners, Switches, transducers and sensors (eg temperature, pressure and pressure) Flow rate sensors) are lead within the process functions such as opening or closing of Valves and the measurement of process parameters. The process control unit receives Signals that indicate process measurements or process variables, which are determined by the field devices or assigned to them, and / or uses other information concerning the field devices this information for implementing a control routine and then generates control signals via one or more of the buses are sent to the field devices to to control the process flow. Information from the field devices and the control unit will typically be one or more Applications available provided by an operator workstation, to carry out an operator desired To allow functions in relation to the process, such as viewing the current process status, a modification of the process flow etc. The increasing number and size of power generation plants, industrial processing plants, room air systems on coal or petroleum base (HVAC systems), devices and instruments etc. significantly pollutes the environment and makes the monitoring and analysis of the measurements made in process control systems of residential complexes, Commercial and industrial areas are carried out, more important. As a result, the increasing competition as well as legal constraints such as aggravated Environmental regulations have led to environmental impact and pollution minimization, environmental safety, operational safety and improved energy efficiency of process control activities within a business to a significant source of profit for the Have become operators of processing plants. Of course it includes the improvement of the profit situation also the avoidance of penalties, Legal proceedings and other costs associated with non-compliance the environmental laws, the regulatory Regulations, safety regulations, etc. One particularly important area of regulations includes the laws, the dangerous pollutant emissions of processing plants to limit. The associated with this emissions legislation Trend goes, the monitoring and control of an extended range of chemical species and other environmental parameters such as the opacity of Pollutants, particle density, turbidity and presence, to demand the type and concentration of microorganisms. Besides, have The regulatory authorities recently passed environmental laws suggested that a higher Measure responsibility for operating owners and / or - to provide manager, by a more detailed and more frequent Reporting on Pollutant data is required. In addition to the increasing importance of environmental aspects and aspects of operational efficiency the importance of the composition and quality of feed streams, intermediate streams and End products for Plant operator and owner become a crucial aspect. For example Regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products, biotechnical products, food products, beverage products and all other products, their product composition and quality one May have an impact on the health and safety of humans constantly increasing control and review by Governments. See, for example, 21 CFR 11. As is well known is, requires the manufacture of health products and safety of people, typically exact Process measurements and control and a manufacturing protocol suitable for the test. A manufacturing protocol for auditing usually involves a complete manufacturing history (ie detailed information regarding conditions, which surround the production of each article of manufacture), confirmations of authorized manufacturing and quality personnel and verification, Validation and comparison of all critical process parameters. In process control systems, although a variety of data analysis tools such as optimization software, maintenance software and a lot  number of other well-known asset management methods, tools, or software used to support such methods, such as in US Patent Application No. 09 / 852,945, entitled ""Remote Analysis of Process Control Plant Data,"" filed May 10 2001, is described; however, the tools and software often result in significant costs to the owner. Ideally, however, the costs associated with the acquisition and maintenance of such asset management tools and software are more than offset by efficiency-based cost reductions that are a direct result of the use of such tools and software. As is well known, these efficiency-based cost reductions result from the fact that the efficient operation of an operation is very dependent on the state of the facilities within the facility and the timing of maintenance on these facilities. Become conventional the performance monitoring devices Uses tools such as input / output algorithms, models, etc., to determine how efficiently an operation works and / or whether through changes during maintenance operations, by replacement of used equipment, modification of facilities, etc. a more cost-effective process can be achieved can. Unfortunately, the monitoring requires of the capacity significant hardware and software (eg. Data analysis tools), and typically will become savvy technicians and other specialists needed to to support the daily monitoring of performance and to control. Many business owners and operators have realized that with operations for performance monitoring high costs are an important area for competing necessary cost reductions have become, especially in the case of Operating smaller plants where economies of scale give a stronger focus pretend to core competencies. customer-side Analytical instruments are a well-known way of measuring and optimizing critical process parameters. Unfortunately, such well-known customer Analytical instruments are relatively expensive and typically require expensive ones protected Communication networks and interfaces. The ones with such customer High cost associated with analytical instruments are further enhanced by that the protected Nature of the communication links between the analytical instruments and the devices within the process control plant it necessary make every processing company a complete set of Has analytical instruments. In other words, with conventional Analytical instruments and data analysis techniques do not allow analysis stream resources between physically separate or remote companies and much less between companies owned by different companies are operated and operated by them, to use jointly. Therefore, you can Typically, relatively small processors typically have the significant Investments do not contribute to the implementation of the customer Analytical instruments or systems are required, and can consequently the improvement of operating efficiency and other benefits that do not realize themselves through these systems. One Although the typical process control system has many process control and instrumentation devices such as valves, transmitters, Sensors, etc., with one or more process control units connected to the software that runs these devices while the process flow controls; however, there are many other supporting devices, which also for the process flow is necessary or related. This extra Devices are, for example, power supply devices, Power generation and distribution equipment, rotating equipment such as turbines, etc., which are typically all within one plant are provided distributed. Create these additional facilities while not necessarily using and becoming process variables in many cases neither controlled by a process control unit nor are they with it coupled to influence the process flow, but these facilities are nevertheless important and ultimately indispensable for the proper functioning of the organization Process. Persons responsible for applications used for business applications, such as ordering parts, supplies, raw materials, etc., and strategic business decisions, such as the choice of products to produce, the in-store optimization variables etc., are typically located in office premises that are remote from both the process control interfaces and the maintenance interfaces. Similarly, managers or other persons may wish to have access to certain information within the processing plant from remote locations or from other computer systems associated with the processing plant for use in operational overview and long-term strategic decision-making. Unfortunately, the fact that the communication links typically used with conventional analytical instrument systems are protected makes it difficult or nearly impossible for authorized users to gain access to important process control data from a remote terminal  get away from the place. Specifically, the remote user wishing to communicate with analytical instrument systems typically needs to use a computer platform that has their own software copies to communicate using the proprietary communication protocol of the instrumentation and process control system of a particular processing plant.

DESCRIPTION THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1is a schematic block diagram of a shared processing device100, which can use Internet-based communications to facilitate data processing and control facilities for a variety of distributed processing operations. Generally speaking, the shared computing device described herein may communicate with one or more processing plants that are spatially remote from each other and from the computing device. As will be described in more detail below, the shared computing device100Use the Internet to enable, analyze, manage, and report on process information or data to a variety of processing companies, each of which includes many and / or different business entities  and respond to ad hoc information requests from operations managers, operators or other authorized users. Generally speaking, the processing companies that work with the shared computing device100Alternatively, individual or groups of processing plants may be owned and operated by several different business entities. In any case, each of the processors may send or receive data or information over the Internet to the shared computing device described herein. The shared computing device may provide many different optimization tools, control tools, diagnostic tools, etc. that may be useful for improving and / or expanding the operation of the processing plants. In this way, the relatively high overhead associated with hardware and software and its maintenance in the data processing device described herein may be shared by a plurality of physically separate and, if desired, a plurality of business entities or operate multiple plants in physically separate locations. In contrast to known systems where it was necessary for each physical operation to have its own data analysis tools (eg, optimization tools, diagnostic tools, etc.), a relatively small processing plant can inexpensively gain the benefits of accessing such tools to realize. In addition, will through the constant Availability of the Internet greatly simplifies the way remote Users, operators, technicians, etc. with a particular operation, a data analysis tool, device, etc. in communication can reach. Unlike traditional ones Process control data analysis techniques and systems typically special (possibly customized) software and sometimes hardware require to communicate with a company that uses a secure communications protocol, allows it is the shared data processing device described herein remote users or operators, access to operating information to receive operations to control etc. by conventional Internet browser software is used on virtually any workstation, running on any portable PC, etc. can be. Furthermore, as described the shared Data processing device allows a user to with the data analysis tools and plants under application conventional Internet browser software to communicate as a visualization layer can they full-fledged skills of well-developed Internet browser software as a graphical user interface influence on increasing the functionality of the decentralized interface sessions of the user. As is well known, Internet browser software provides typically applets ready that can be used to To look at information in real time. If desired, can hence the shared data analyzer described herein Use applets in one or more web pages that have it Users allow process control data from a particular operation to look at in real time. Furthermore Internet browser software can, if desired, flexible display and Journal formatting capabilities Offer what it's to operators of one operation, managers or another User allows to specify customer specific, how the Process information presented shall be. As1indicates the collaborative facility100a redundant server cluster102that has a lot of redundant servers110.112and114and a plurality of data history devices116and118all of them via a data bus120communicatively coupled. The data bus120may be an Ethernet based local area network or other suitable data bus. The redundant servers110to114may also be via respective communication links124.126and128communicative with the internet122be coupled. The communication routes124to128may be any suitable hardwired link such as a telephone line or any suitable radio link such as a satellite link or a mobile phone connection. As1further shows, a first business entity130comprising a first and a second processing plant132and134has, a communication line136use the communications between their operations132and134and the redundant servers110to114over the internet122allows. As in the case of communication links124to128can the communication line136be any suitable hardwired or radio link. Similarly, a second business entity138a third processing plant140comprising a communication link142used to the third processing company via the Internet122communicatively with the redundant servers110to114to pair. Generally speaking, the redundant servers110to114act as a cluster of redundant servers that are responsible for collecting, processing, organizing, archiving, and reporting (such as presenting) analytical and real-time Pro  data are responsible. In particular, each of the servers110.112and114one or more respective applications (ie software)150to160that can perform complex calculations and that can perform change management for a process and / or operation. By way of example only, the applications may150to160Data analysis tools, distributed process management tools, process optimization tools, continuous emission monitoring and minimization tools, distributed energy management tools, development and optimization tools, central monitoring and management tools for a multi-client HVAC system, monitoring and control tools for a decentralized water and wastewater treatment plant , Tools for pharmaceutical and biotechnological processes, data management and control, semiconductor process control and data management tools, or other desired software tools that may be used to augment or enhance the operation of a processing plant and / or communications. Furthermore, the redundant cluster of servers110to114can be used to validate data prior to presentation (ie, display) of that data to a user, and can have a relatively high level of process management and reporting capabilities. In addition, the redundant cluster of servers110to114Store and / or have access to properties (eg, steam tables, chemical tables, etc.) and methods (eg, applications specific to a particular user).1While there are three servers, it will be appreciated that more or less servers may be used without departing from the scope of the invention. The redundant servers110to114can historical process control data on the data bus120to the data history devices116and118send and receive from them. In this way, the shared data processing device100Organize and store process control data, analysis results, reports, or other information pertaining to the operation, process, etc. process, or store it in a non-volatile memory as necessary. One of the redundant servers110to114can act as a primary server while the other servers are continuously synchronized with the primary server and can act as backup servers. Such a backup function can be performed by one or more of the servers110to114be activated to continuously monitor the health and performance of the primary server. If a failure or degradation of the primary server is either detected or expected to occur, one or more of the backup servers may take over data processing, analysis, etc., and take over the operation of the failed or near failing primary server. It is important that the business entities130and138capable of handling significant process data sets, analysis results, etc. within the computing device100which allows the secure, decentralized storage of potentially important process information and facilitates any future audit (eg by a regulatory authority) of this important process information.

For example, one of the protocols PROFIBUS®,®WORLDFIP could instead of or field devices are used in addition to the Fieldbus devices, Device-Net®,AS-Interface and CAN use. Thus, it allows the internet-enabled field device interface224a variety of intelligent and / or non-intelligent field devices, over the Internet122with the shared data processing device described herein via a communication link251communicate without the field devices226to230Internet-capable embedded data servers or embedded data history devices must have, as with the Internet-capable intelligent field devices210and212be used. Alternatively, the internet-enabled field device224are based on a lower functionality platform, such as a remote terminal unit (RTU), which is a well-known control system platform. The redundant data compression nodes214and216are at a higher level  the hierarchy of the operational or process control system and may process control data and other process information from the Internet-enabled intelligent field devices210and212, the internet capable field device224and other devices or systems over the system data bus232collect.

In this case, the primary node may be from the compression nodes214and216over the system level data bus232and the web server218send and receive (ie, organize) information to the shared data processing device described herein. In addition, the redundant data history devices220and222used to process control data, diagnostic data or other information or data that the process control system200concern, organize and archive. The data servers used in conjunction with the shared computing device described herein may utilize any desired data compression technique to minimize bandwidth consumption without sacrificing data content or data accuracy. Additionally or alternatively, the embedded data servers234.235and242used in internet-enabled smart field devices210and212, the internet enabled field device interface224and / or the web server218to use data compression to minimize bandwidth consumption. By way of example only, data compression techniques may be performed using well known techniques such as transmission of exceptions (ie, insignificant data changes are not transmitted), Fourier or wavelet transmission, transmitting frequency domain coefficients reconstituted by the receiving device to the original real time signal, etc. Of course, all could other known or yet to be developed data compression techniques, without departing from the scope of the invention. The shared data processing device described herein may employ various data correction techniques to correct sensor deviations (ie, degradation of sensor accuracy over time) and sensor failure. The redundant data server110to114in the shared data processing device100may execute applications that provide for automatic digital verification, data validation, reconciliation, and periodic or event triggered automatic data source recalibration (for sensors or other devices equipped with this capability). Furthermore, the data processing device shared by the computer100The data correction applications of the present invention have failure and deviation detection circuits and / or logic that detect when a sensor or device has deviated beyond (or is about to deviate) beyond the self-correction range. In response to detection of such an underflow or overflow condition, the failure and deviation detection circuitry and / or logic may perform a 'bumpless' measurement substitution, wherein the last known good measurement from the failing sensor or device to a redundant sensor or sensor a redundant device is transmitted, and may then generate an alarm message for the failed o the failing device. Of course, more complex data correction or substitution procedures such as a neural network model or correlation model may be used instead. In either case, the shared computing device may then utilize diagnostic information pertaining to the failed sensor or failed device to autonomously request or trigger the required maintenance for that failed sensor or device. In instances where a sensor does not have an automatic recalibration capability, the shared computing device described herein may utilize redundant measurements, heat flow and mass balances, and / or process models to develop correction factors applied to measurements taken by inaccurate sensors and other devices thereby avoiding the need for immediate removal, replacement or maintenance of these devices. To simplify the data correction capabilities of the shared computing device described herein, the various data servers used in the system may include, for example, the embedded servers234.235and242, the data compression nodes214and216and the redundant servers110to114Add timestamp and data quality parameters to data between an operation and the shared computing device100be transmitted.

In particular, if certain EPA emission limits are exceeded (or near a threshold and will soon exceed it), a warning or alarm message may be automatically sent by the shared computing device to the operations management, government agencies, and so on. If desired, the alarm messages may be routed to automatically dispatch a service person or other person who may be capable of examining and / or correcting the predicted or current condition causing the alarm. Such alerts may be transmitted using e-mail messages, pager messages, or any other desired reporting mechanism. Alternatively or additionally, the shared computing device described herein may transmit emission data to asset management and / or government regulatory authorities using a previously approved format. Since the collaborative computing device can generate alarm messages indicating that there is a danger of exceeding an emission limit and can send these messages to an asset manager or operator, it is possible that the asset manager or operator may avoid a potentially costly non-compliance with a government policy , In addition to providing alert or alarm messages in response to emission levels that exceed or are about to exceed regulatory limits, the collaborative computing device may also be used for environmental management, using the collaborative computing device optimization applications to minimize soiling levels (in the Contrast to a mere warning that such values are close to limits or exceed legal limits). For example, CEMD may be used to provide input values for a common vector gradient technique, a neural network technique, and / or a Fibonacci search technique for operational emission optimization and operational emission minimization. Thus, the shared computing device described herein may serve to provide alert functions as well as control functions that include balancing control or automatic safety shutdown of an operation and optimization of operating processes, thereby minimizing environmental impact and improving the operational safety and integrity of the devices become. More generally, such automatic or balancing control functions can also serve to increase product production rates and quality, which can significantly increase the profitability of the operation.

792,FI-122277-B,A method for controlling a paper or board machine ,2002,"METHOD FOR PAPER OR PAPERBOARD MACHINE TRACK MANAGEMENT The invention relates to a method for controlling a paper or board machine, wherein the machine comprises two or more successive subassemblies, such as a forming part, a press part, a drying part and a finishing device, for making paper or board 5, and at least determine the cleanliness level of the cordless area and - perform the necessary cleaning operations on the paper scraps, - check the cleanliness level, 15 - adjust the conditions for export or production of the headband, - export the headband in one or more steps and - distribute the headband to full width. 20 Nowadays, the speeds of paper and board machines, both of which will be referred to as generic paper machines, have increased, for example, from the perspective of track management. A significant part of paper machine productivity is its drive ability. Although there have been many attempts to improve runnability, paper breaks sometimes occur on a paper machine. Restarting production in the event of a stoppage often requires, for example, cleaning measures and o i- * 30 through the threading procedure of the machine. Other susceptible to breakage Er situations where the said threading procedure is also performed- CL ^ ri, is the start-up of the machine after a shutdown, and possibly also the species changes. (M o o C \ J 35 Such objects critical to web breaks are located on the wet end of the machine, for example with a press section. Further, the drying section, the possible coating stations (positions 1 and 2) and the roller 2, especially when changing the tambourine, may equally be subject to interruptions. In the event of a break, even time to find out the exact break point can be wasted. For example, the paper machine may have unclear interruptions at the boundary between the press section and the drying section 5, as well as the intermediate calender and the coating station. A significant part of the reduction of the break time is played by, among other things, developing head threading and related equipment, facilitating cleaning during the break and improving the reliability of the break control-10 equipment. In the prior art, for example, the procedures just related to the stoppage situation and the subsequent threading procedure are currently performed either completely manually or, for example, with the help of blows, in which case the operator is also responsible for performing the procedure. Further, the threading can be carried out using, for example, various threaded conveyor, plate and rope sheaves. They are also controlled and adjusted by the paper machine operator from, for example, 20 control consoles. The state-of-the-art production uplift and the one-step threading procedure that it involves requires that the equipment adjustments and process conditions be changed to a level that requires successful threading. These adjustments and ^ adjustments are also made manually by the operator using the controls on the control console, o (M Particularly in the event of a breakdown, X £ 30 to clean up the paper wreckage caused by the break. At present, cleaning is performed manually by a machine operator. Of a subdivision or (OF Depending on the destination, it is carried out, for example, by air blasting or washing, in which the paper wreck is removed from the machine structure. The blowing air is brought in and directed by the staff to their 3 cleaning sites, for example, with a hose that is difficult to move and even dangerous when the machine is running. Moving components of a papermaking machine, such as rollers and cylinders, are generally kept rotating during cleaning operations, since completely stopping them would unduly delay production ramp-up. Thus, for example, there is a risk that the person performing the cleaning operations will drift close to the rotating components while working, or that the blowing hose supported by the latter will become entangled in the moving component, with the consequences being invariably fatal. These cleaning operations alongside the components in motion thus entail serious safety risks, which make them subject to stringent safety rules that are particularly difficult to comply with at present 15. In spite of the routine that a paper machine operator may have developed over several years of service, the head-to-head procedure always involves the possibility of human error. 20 Such is the case, for example, with the momentary awakening of the operator's alertness. Further, the manual, thread-routine thread count procedure repeatedly performed by countless repetitions, may occur time and again according to the customary suboptimal mode of operation that has evolved over the years, based on human experience. Nowadays, despite the well-programmed paper machine control system, V, the operator is just in the process of moving it CM in addition, several machine running parameters and task must be observed X £ 30 solutions to adjust these for the successful completion of the threading procedure. δ tn CM As prior art reference is made to FI-109939 and WO- CM 02/20901, which show purification measures during production 35. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for fully automating the web management of a paper and / or board machine, which is substantially more efficient and safer than currently known methods. The characteristic features of the process according to the invention are set forth in claim 1. In the method of the invention, track management functions such as cleaning, threading procedure, and production start-up are performed independently of the operator on the machine 10 control system as a fully automated event sequence. The method utilizes machine vision technology and, according to a more advanced embodiment, known algorithms for character recognition and digitization of image information. Further, values detected by the machine measuring system or other track sensors can be utilized to detect track presence and determine the characteristics of the headband 15 for successful production ramp-up. The process according to the invention can be advantageously applied to the production ramp-up stages carried out at different stages of 20 paper machines. The observation of the purity level of the machine structures and components can be arranged by means of observation in several directions. This provides certainty for the detection and assurance of cleanliness levels in areas critical to complex machine structures and outages. In addition to the observation means T, according to the method of the invention, the automatically controlled machine structure cleaning means can be arranged to be movable and directional instead of a fixed o V arrangement. (M so they can operate to the desired cleaning X £ 30 per item, tn § The automatic ramp up method according to invention C \ 10 o integrated into the machine control system can be CM connect artificial intelligence so that it can be organized into a so-called 35 ""learning system"". 5 The method according to the invention achieves a significantly improved safety level of a paper machine and fulfills the safety regulations set to ensure occupational safety for the operating personnel of the machine. Further, the production efficiency of the machine is significantly improved compared to the known one, because the threading failures and production losses due to human error, fatigue and possible unfavorable threading procedure of the machine operator are completely eliminated by the method according to the invention. Other additional advantages obtainable by the process of the invention will be apparent from the description and features of the appended claims. The method of the invention, which is not limited to the embodiments shown below, will be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a schematic view of an example of a paper machine, Figure 2 is an example of a press section of a paper machine according to the invention, Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a drying machine in accordance with the invention, Fig. 4a shows an example of the space between the dryer section of the paper machine and the reel, and Fig. 4b shows a top view of Fig. 4a. δ ^ The rough diagram shown in Figure 1 shows an o V paper machine. The machine consists of subassemblies, which are: CM a web forming section 10, a press section 11, a multi-stage drying section £ 30 12, and a finishing device 13, which in the example is m rollers. The after-treatment device 13 may also be a coating device, a calender or a subsequent after-drying section, or some CM o a combination of the above (for example, machine calender roller). CM The method according to the invention can be applied advantageously to every sub-assembly of a paper machine. Further, with each of the 6 subassemblies, the method can be applied at several different stops and at the export stage of the headband. Next, the method according to the invention will first be described in the ramping of the press section 5 11 as a result of the web break caused by the press section 11 and the subsequent ramping up of the drying section 12 and further in lifting the web to the reel 13. Figure 2 shows an example of a press section 11 of a papermaking machine. During machine production, the press section 11 may cause a web break 10 caused, for example, by the paper web 32 engaging in the center roll 17. In the web break 32 sub-modules. In this case, the pieces of paper may have subassemblies at several different locations, which, for example, impedes the subsequent threading. The breakpoint is determined in the method according to the invention by utilizing, for example, machine measuring or sensor systems. A first example of a sensor already used in the machine for determining the break point of the press member 11 may be the detection of the track 32 by photocells 21.1, 21.2. The photocells 21.1, 21.2 may be located at different positions on the press member 11 and generally on the machine. However, the observation based on photoelectric cells 21.1, 21.2 ^ has certain uncertainties as it may (M , gives incorrect information about the presence of track 32, for example 0 ""'l in the event that it has accumulated in its detection area C \ J loose scraps of paper. According to another preferred embodiment, the superimposition of the track 32 on the track 32 may be monitored by reflection of the light beam transmitted against the track 32 (PosiEye). When the track 32 is on, it reflects the 35 beams of light transmitted by the sensor 21.3 at a given intensity. The intensity of the light beam reflected from the paper web 32 is substantially stronger than the light beam intensity reflected from the machine structures 7 received by the sensor 21.3 when the web 32 is off. According to a third preferred embodiment, for example, the tension values of track 32 at different measuring positions can be observed. As an example, measurement data 10 or tension measurement can be provided in the region 25 between the dryer section 12 and the reel 13 through the paper web 32 cross-section measuring device 23 (Figures 1 and 4a). In the measurement, at the tension measurement points following the break point or the like, a sharp decrease in the track tension, for example, is observed in the web break condition. Also at tension measurement points upstream of the break point, it is possible to observe that the tension is maintained or also sharply reduced depending on the break point in the machine direction. Other observers or measurement values may also be used to determine the presence of the track 32 and the location of the break. Machine track control automation deduces the occurrence of a line break from the change reported by the selected observation 20 or gauge, locating it for a particular subset and possibly within a subset according to the gauge or sensor that identified it. In the event of a break in the press section 11, the pick-up roll 19 is raised and the running web 32 from the wire section 10 is guided from the boundary of the wire section 10 and the press section 11 to the pulper (not shown). A signal indicating a failure condition V is transmitted to the area of the press section 11 iM to a fire cleaning system that includes one or more X £ 30 suitably positioned cleaning showers 31.1, id 31.2. Simultaneously, one or more conveniently located sighting means disposed on the press section 11, which may be optical imaging devices such as (M for example, digital cameras 30.1, 30.2, start capturing a location-35 known interruption area. The cameras 30.1, 30.2 are arranged on different subassemblies of the machine as needed so that they provide a sufficiently wide range of information, in particular, from sensitive areas, without excluding other areas. Further, the cameras 30.1, 30.2 may be arranged in the transverse frames of the machine 5, instead of being fixed, such that they are traverse or that they can rotate indefinitely in their stop (not shown). For example, the image information transmitted by the cameras 30.1, 30.2 may be digitized in a manner known per se by converting (if not already prepared) the image-10 information into grayscale images, the grayscale values being scaled to 256 parts. A grayscale value is set to a threshold below which values, i.e. lighter areas, are interpreted as paper and darker areas as machine structures. The clean machine structures may have a so-called zero image stored at each of the 15 imaging positions, which is free of paper waste or other similar impurities. The digitized grayscale images transmitted by the cameras 30.1, 30.2 are compared to these zero images and based on them, the automatic track management system according to the invention draws conclusions about the positions that need to be cleaned. At its simplest, depending on the lightness of the machine structures and of the imaging position environment, the intermittent image information transmitted by the cameras 30.1, 30.2 without the so-called blank image may be sufficient. In the method according to the invention, the cleaning system of the press section 11 is formed of various water and air jets 31.1, 31.2. The showers 31.1, 31.2 are located in known areas which are critical to the outages and are CM movable and redirected to their cleaning destination. According to a preferred embodiment of x £ 30, the orientation of the jets m 31.1, 31.2 of the cleaning system is coupled to the information provided by § 30.1, 30.2 of the camera system, whereby the orientation of the jets 31.1, 31.2 CM o can be set in the cross machine direction for cameras 30.1, 30.2 CM based on locations and angles. After cleaning, 35 camera systems check the cleaning result. If the cleaning result is not satisfactory, it is continued, for example, by changing the position and orientation of the jets 31.1, 31.2 to achieve the desired result. 9 Upon acceptance of the cleaning result, the automated track-5 manager is instructed to initiate the track 32 threading procedure. Hereby, the pick-up roll 19 of the press section 11 is lowered and the web 32 is taken to the central roll 17 or, depending on the machine type, the web 32 can also be guided directly to the first drying cylinder 12.1 of the drying section 12. 10 While the press section 11 has been subjected to automated cleaning and threading operations in accordance with the method of the invention, the dryer section 12 and subsequent post-treatment device 13 are also prepared for the threading procedure. Similar purposefully positioned camera and cleaning systems presented on the puri-tin section 11 have been subjected to cleaning procedures of the drying section 12 and the post-treatment section, i.e., in this example, the roller 13, and checked for cleanliness of subassemblies 12, 13 to the level required by the successful Figure 3 shows one of the drying members 12 'of the drying section 12 implementing the method according to the invention. Between the vacuum rollers 18, on-line monitoring sensors 21.4, 21.5 are disposed on the drying section 12, which may also be based on measuring the light reflectance (PosiEye) according to the above principle. Further, the drying section 12 is provided with o V, e.g. CM glazing cameras 30.3, 30.4 and cleaning jets 31.3 which, in the case of x £ 30 dryer section 12, are air jets. The air jets 31.3 m are arranged to blow the loose S and the scrap of paper scraped by the drying cylinders 16 of the scrapers 37 into the basement. CM When cameras 30.1, 30.2 and track sensors 21.1, 21.2 communicate the successful capture of track 32 by press section 11, 10, the threading procedure from press section 11 to dryer section 12 can be initiated. In accordance with the method of the invention, 12 for threading (not shown). With the exception of the cut thread, the rest of the web 32 is led to the pulper (not shown). Once the tension of the threading strap at the end of the press section 11 is found to be at a suitable level for successful threading, the strap guidance to the dry section 10 is performed in a known manner. The threading procedure of the drying section 12 is carried out automatically according to the method of the invention in a manner known per se. Cameras 30.3, 30.4 and other known track control devices 21.4, 21.5 detect a successful threading of the dryer section 12, which is generally performed in a single step with current machine concepts. Once the threading strap has been successfully guided to the end of the drying section 12, the web 32 is automatically extended to its full width by a chamfering device (not shown) arranged at the boundary between the press section 11 and the drying section 12. If there is a web break in the drying section 12, the web 32 is routed from the cut-off point or the preceding drying group boundary to the basement floor and further to the pulper (not shown). Figure 4a shows an intermediate region 25 of the drying section 12 and the roller 13. In the intermediate region 25, cameras 30.5, 30.6, 30.7 are also provided at appropriate locations to provide sufficient information about the level of purity in the region. In addition to the example (M f-cameras can also be located on or below the structures, g 30 The cleaning jets 31.4, 31.5 are also arranged so that the LOs provide the required cleaning result. δ LT) (M § When track 32 has been successfully extended to full width- C \ J At the end of the drying section 12 and after the cleaning of the intermediate region 25 and the reel 13 35 is completed, a cut-off strap for cutting the reel 13 is cut. Preferably, the threading cut 11 is carried out, for example, in the middle of the track 32 by a double-chamfering device 14 (DoubleJet). The device 14 is disposed, for example, against the second vacuum vacuum roll 18 'so that its jets cut against the threading belt 5 and the vacuum vacuum 18' beneath it. Immediately after cutting, the threading strap 39 is guided through an intermediate region 25 of the drying section 12 and the reel 13. In the intermediate region 25, the threading strap 39 and later the track 32 are supported, inter alia, on the guide rolls 22, 24, 27, 38. Leading is effected, for example, by the use of vacuum, blowing, or combinations thereof. The concept of the example employs vacuum-based threading devices 33.1, 33.2, 33.3, 33.4, 33.5, 33.6 (FoilForcel), arranged in 15 six portions 25 between the drying section 12 and the roller 13 at all open intervals. Other types of threading and exporting techniques are also possible. Reference numeral 26 illustrates a steam box for adjusting track 32 to a good moisture profile. 20 Figure 4b shows a view formed by the information transmitted by the cameras 30.5, 30.6, 30.7 of the space 25 between the drying section 12 and the reel 13, corresponding to the concept shown in Figure 4a, seen from above. The picture shows the best time to spread the track 32 25 (dashed area) with a device 14 from the headband to the T-39 production width. The picture shows an example of what can be (M , to investigate the purity level of the area 25 and to perform cleaning operations with the showers 31.4, 31.5. structures CM any paper scraps adhered would appear in Fig. x £ 30 in a manner similar to the web 32 and ribbon 39 shown herein. δ in CM o Replacement of the 13 tambourines on the roller, possible setting of speed differences CM The wetting and wetting of the paper web during the insertion and application of the web are also carried out automatically according to the method of the invention. 12 After the said initialization operations have also been performed on the reel 13, the threading from the drying section 12 to the reel 13 is initiated. The success of the threading procedure is observed by means of the properly arranged machine vision / camera system 5 described. The tension of a successful threading belt 39 is identified, for example, by a tension measurement (e.g., IQ-tension) or weighing (not shown) located between the dryer section 12 and the reel 13 and by a temperature measurement 15. The tension value and 10 criterion for the automatic roll-out of track 32 to full-width. Once the web has been applied to the lowering point of the reel 13, the sequence of events 15 continues with the auto-take-up of the reel 13, in which the full-width web 32 is blown on an empty tambourine 34. The paper machine is then in production run. According to a preferred embodiment, the automatic track management method according to the invention integrated into the machine control system 20 can be coupled with artificial intelligence, whereby it can be arranged as a so-called ""learning system"". In this case, in addition to being able to draw attention to potential known problem areas, the automation arranged in accordance with the method registers and records new and frequently occurring problem areas in the event of interruptions and takes them into account in subsequent interruptions. The information can be utilized o V for example when searching for a break point and cleaning jets (M to precisely these learned problems. The £ 30 id sub-assembly 10, 11, 12, 13 may also be illuminated at least during the purity level determination and inspection by ultraviolet light. It improves the separation of the waste paper itself (M machine structures because it causes many grades of paper to ""35 glow"" (not shown). 13 It is essential in the method according to the invention that the execution of the above-described sequence of events, i.e., break detection and location, purity level detection, cleaning operations and threading procedure, is performed by a machine control system 5 fully automated. Furthermore, it should be noted that the placement of the cameras and showers shown in the figures is only rough and exemplary. It is to be understood that the foregoing description and the accompanying drawings are intended only to illustrate the method of the present invention. Thus, the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth above or as defined in the claims, but many variations and modifications of the invention which are possible within the scope of the inventive concept defined in the appended claims will be apparent to those skilled in the art. δ c \ i ό CM X cc CL LO δ LO CM o o CM"

STATE OF TECHNOLOGY In In recent years, a symptom called ""economy-class syndrome"" has been emphasized or highlighted. This symptom can cause a blood circulation disorder, such as thrombosis, which consists of sitting on a tight or narrow seat in one Plane for many hours without moving the legs results. Specifically, one would Pumping effect by muscle contraction around blood vessels no longer effective be what a body could bring into a state where the blood in a vein is more likely due to congestion or blockage (stagnation) of the blood would lump. Of the thus developed lump is called a thrombus. It is it has been said that in a case where the thrombus has been specifically created in a vein is that in a deep or low-lying area of a thigh or thigh (thrombus of a low-lying vein) located or localized is when the vulnerable Person in this state begins to go, then the thrombus swim or ride the bloodstream, which is a vessel in one Could block the lungs, what a pulmonary thrombosis embolism develop and worst of all Case would result in the death of the person concerned. This Symptom would not exclusively originated in the plane or developed, but the report says it also some cases This symptom is what happens during a long drive or at a car Working in a sitting position have arisen. The Symptom especially in an area of a lower leg or a lower extremity originated as a thrombosis of a deep-seated vein in medical Language, and it is assumed that in a preventive measure moderate or Moderately moving the muscles around the blood circulation in the legs to stimulate, this symptom can prevent while only a moving of a torso, without to move the legs would bring no effect or effect. The means that the Origin or development of thromboses of deep-seated veins Movement of the legs can be prevented to a moderate extent.

FIG. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Thrombosis of deep venous veins is thought to be developed in those having such a condition in which blood is susceptible to being stored within veins located in a deep region of a lower leg. It is also believed that those showing a smaller deviation in the amount of blood within the vein located in the deep area of the lower leg by a change in a body direction has a status, in a determination device of the present invention, a subject is instructed to change his / her body orientation from one to another in order to develop a thrombosis of a deep-seated vein Apply stress to muscle in the area of the lower leg. This is because the blood stored in the vein located in the deep area of the lower leg can be completely circulated within the body with the aid of the muscular pumping action caused by changing the posture of the subject. A measurement of a difference in value  The bioelectrical impedance between before and after this change of posture can help to assess a movement of a bodily fluid (blood) within the body. Around the posture to change the subject can those movements that are a flexing and stretching exercise, a bending and stretching the knee in a sitting position and a repeated action of getting up and putting down, as useful in Can be considered or considered and then a deviation or change in bioelectrical impedance values before and after the change to be measured in posture or position, by those movements are compared with a reference value, thereby determining whether or not the subject has the condition capable or not suitable is the thrombosis of low lying veins in the area of To develop lower leg. 1FIG. 12 is a graph showing a characteristic of a deviation in a bioelectrical impedance obtained from a result of a test in which the inventors of the present invention, the bioelectrical impedance between one and the other foot over a certain period of time in connection with the change have actually measured an attitude for a plurality of subjects. In The above test of measurements became the subject's movement first limited, so as not to move her lower legs while reclining or lying position for a predetermined period of time (about 20 minutes) has been maintained, then the subject was instructed, his / her body direction or orientation in a standing position and in a standing position (for about 15 Minutes) and the subject was back in the reclining or lying position and forced his / her lower legs (for about 20 minutes) not to move. As can be seen from the graph, since the subject in the standing or sitting position before the first reclining or lying position, the body fluid, like blood and lymph, stored a lot in the area of the lower legs, and as soon as the subject is the reclining one or lying position, the body fluid is no longer in one special or special area of the body stored but over the whole body distributed or distributed. As far as the area of the lower leg is concerned, was the amount of body fluid decreases and thereby the value of bioelectrical impedance observed or monitored, gradually to increase. Then begins when the subject's body orientation in the standing position changes that Blood and / or the lymph, by the movement of the lower leg muscles (the muscular Pumping action) to be circulated when getting up, while the Blood and / or the lymph which spreads over the whole body or have begun to spread, in the field the lower leg due to the standing position to be stored whereby the value of the bioelectrical impedance is caused to fall in one go. After that, as the amount of body fluid, that is stored in the lower legs or is getting bigger, the value of bioelectrical impedance continues to get smaller, where however, if he agrees Level of body fluid approaches, to be stored in the lower legs, the value of the bioelectric Impedance between two feet a gradual Decline shows. It is assumed that this gradient of the bioelectric Impedance in dependence from a difference or a difference in capacity in the Area of a lower leg of the subject for storing the body fluid, as the blood and / or the lymph, can be changed, with one Person who allows that one bigger amount of a body fluid stored in the lower legs, has a larger gradient, while a Person who permits or permits a lesser Amount of a body fluid stored in the lower legs, a smaller gradient Has. After that begins or begins when the subject is limited again, around the lower legs in the reclining or lying position, the blood and / or the lymph, which were stored in the lower legs, spread or to be distributed and the amount of body fluid in the area of Lower leg is reduced, reducing the value of bioelectric Impedance gradually elevated becomes. From the facts described above, it is considered that the change in the bioelectrical impedance value is induced in the case of the change from one position to another position, and that the gradient or the degree of change of the bioelectrical impedance between two postures is involved with the capacity of the subject to store the blood and / or lymph in the lower legs and / or whether the body fluid is smoothly transferred during a change in posture, eg, from the standing position to the reclined position , In this point, a person who is more capable of transferring and storing a large amount of body fluid in the area of the lower legs may have the bioelectrical impedance value that could continue to decrease rapidly as he / she continues to do so / she the  Postures change from the reclined position to the standing position. That is, the person having a higher ability to transfer the body fluid to the lower leg area and a higher capacity to store the blood in the lower leg area is associated with greater chances of blood stagnation and a longer storage period, and such a person may be considered to have the condition that allows the blood to be more easily stored in the region or region of lower legs. consequently may be a device for determining or determining device The present invention also from the gradient of a bioelectric Impedance determine whether the subject has the condition or not, which is suitable for the thrombosis of low-lying veins of the lower leg develop. Farther considered an apparatus for determining the present invention an age and / or a gender of the subject and / or a degree of relevance of the subject for some Factors assumed to be deeper in a thrombosis To be involved or involved in a vein Perform determination, whether the subject has a condition suitable for the thrombosis develop low-lying veins. Yet Further, an apparatus for determining the present invention a council / message for a method of preventing thrombosis of deep-seated veins to disposal put. DESCRIPTION SOME EXAMPLES An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.2shows a schematic perspective view of an apparatus for determining thrombosis of deep veins in the region of the lower leg. This device1for the purpose of construction is constructed as a single body, with a seat section2and on which a subject can sit, and includes a control box3which is placed in the front portion thereof. The control box3includes an ad4serving as informing means for displaying a plurality of sets of information, such as measured results and messages, and an input device5acting as an input means comprising a plurality of circuits which under the display4are arranged.

The control box3also includes a paper ejector6afor ejecting a printed sheet of paper on which the information, such as results and messages, are printed by the printer6have been printed, which is not shown, however. In addition, measuring clamps or clamps are or will be7a.7bcomprising bioelectrical impedance measuring electrodes on the left and right side surfaces of the control box3over cords or cables8arespectively.8bconnected and those clips or clamps7a.7bare to attach ankle to the subject. In the inner or inner side of the measuring clamp7afor the right foot are a power supply electrode9aand a voltage measuring electrode10aInstalled. Although not shown in the drawing tion, the measuring clamp7bfor the left foot on a similar configuration. The side surface of the control box3is also provided with a clip holder to which the measuring clamp is hung while it is not used, and2shows a state of the measuring clamp7aon the clip holder16ais suspended. 3is a block diagram of the determining device1, The power supply electrodes9a.9bare or will be with a power supply unit21connected, which serves as a power supply means, and this power supply unit21is with an arithmetic controller22for performing a number of operations and controls of respective devices. Next are or are the Spannungsmeßelektroden10a.10bwith a voltage measuring unit23connected, which serves as a voltage measuring means, and this Spannungsmeßeinheit23is or is also with the arithmetic control22connected. The arithmetic controller or the arithmetic controller22Beyond that with the ad4to display results, the input device5, full  a plurality of switches, the printer6to print the results, a storage unit24which serves as storage means for storing various information such as a set of input data and measured bioelectrical impedance values, and a clock25connected to measure a predetermined period of time. In addition, a power supply unit operates or functions28to the arithmetic controller22and to provide each of other units and devices with electrical power. now to4turning, a flow of operations in the determining device becomes1of the present invention. First, the circuit breaker5aand respective units and devices, such as the arithmetic controller22and the storage unit24in the determination device1are initialized to a state (step S1) ready to determine whether the setting switch5bfor setting a personal physical information is pressed (step S2). The respective units and devices would be held in the standby states until the set switch5bis pressed and accordingly drives the display4continue to display an original or initial screen on it. When the setting switch5bis pressed, it is determined as YES in step S2, and the process moves to steps S3 to S5 to obtain an input of the personal information for a subject. In this embodiment, the up-switch5cand / or the down switch5dpressed to change an initial value or information shown in the display4displayed to indicate a correct age, gender and body size of the subject, and then the decision / limit switch5eto confirm the set value or the information (steps S3 to S5). When next At step S6, an input operation is executed the subject has any relevance factors, of which is assumed, the emergence of thrombosis of low-lying veins in the area of the lower leg.  If there will be any relevant items or items among them a counted Number entered by these relevant points. After completing the setting of the number of relevant points, all of the points which have been set in steps S3 to S6 are displayed4displayed (step S7). Then a statement will appear on the display4displayed to guide the subject, the measuring clips7a.7bto put on both feet (step S8). The subject puts the measuring clamps7a.7bto his / her two feet in fairly upper places of the respective ankle respectively.5shows the measuring clamps7a.7bthat have been attached to the feet of the subject. After completing the attachment of the measuring clamps7a.7bthe subject pushes the decision / limit switch5e(Step S9). At this stage, the display shows4""Keep calm with your legs motionless and stay seated"" and the clock25is activated to start counting down a predetermined time period (step S10). This can bring the subject to a state where the blood is applied or being forced to stand in the legs by limiting the movements the legs to be stored. A few minutes of a restriction should be necessary to achieve this, and in this embodiment a five-minute interval provided or available posed. Consequently, the clock stops or counts25for 5 minutes, and after this five-minute interval has passed (step S11), a bioelectrical impedance measurement between both feet of the subject is started. An alternating current from the power supply  Ness21gets into the body of the subject via the power supply electrodes9a.9bdelivered and a voltage between the voltage measuring electrodes10a.10bis through the voltage measuring unit23measured while the arithmetic controller22calculates the bioelectrical impedance value of the subject based on the value of the alternating current and the voltage value (step S12). The calculated value of bioelectrical impedance is in the memory unit24stored (step S13). At this stage, in order to cause a change in the body direction, an instruction for instructing the subject to perform a flexion and extension exercise is displayed4displayed. In this embodiment, it instructs the subject10To make cycles of flexing and stretching exercises (step S14). The subject stands from the sitting section2get up and do the exercises as instructed, and then sit back on the sitting section2and press the decision / limit switch5e(Step S15). At this stage, the arithmetic controller measures22again the bioelectrical impedance (step S16). Then the arithmetic controller uses22the value of the bioelectrical impedance measured at this stage and another bioelectrical impedance value stored in the memory unit24at step S13 to perform an arithmetic operation. In this arithmetic operation, a difference (Δ BI) between the bioelectrical impedance values before and after the body posture change is calculated by using an equation below, and thus the calculated value is compared with a reference value to make a determination based on whether the Reference value is exceeded or not.ΔBI = (BI value before change of posture) - (BI value after change of posture) (1) It should be noted that the reference value is represented by the Δ BI (reference BI), which is calculated by these values before and after the change in posture of an ordinary healthy person and is different depending on the particular sex and age, and consequently, a plurality of reference values have been stored in the memory unit24saved. This is based on the consideration that it is typically more likely for women to develop thrombosis of deep lower leg veins compared to men, as well as for the elderly. Accordingly, a higher reference BI is selected for the female or older subject and used for the comparison. In addition, the reference value BI may be modified in response to the degree of relevance of the subject for corresponding factors involved in the lower leg thrombosis of lower leg veins set in step S6. Again, the higher reference BI is selected for the higher degree of relevance (step S17). Now is used by using concrete numbers, a procedure of a Determination will be described. It is assumed that the bioelectrical impedance values measured between both feet are 500 Ω and 450 Ω respectively before and after the bending and stretching exercises. The reference BI selected was 30 Ω. Then, using equation (1)Δ BI = 500-450 = 50 In In this case, the Δ BI greater than the reference value BI, it is determined that the subject is normal. It it is assumed that the muscular Pumping action, which is caused by the bending and stretching exercises, the blood in the low-lying veins of the lower leg is saved by the body to be circulated, and associated with this is the value of bioelectric Impedance weaker have fallen or fallen. The determination is based on the idea that one such deviation in the impedance value in those healthy persons which is believed to be less likely to occur To develop thrombosis of low-lying veins of the lower leg. In this embodiment, the case of a Δ BI value equal to or greater than the reference value (30 Ω) is specified as a level 0 indicating a lower probability of development. The case of a Δ BI value smaller than the reference value (30 Ω) but greater than 2/3 thereof (20 Ω) is specified as a Level 1 or Level 1, the case of a Δ BI value is equal to or smaller than 2 / 3 of the reference value BI (20 Ω) but greater than 1/3 thereof (10 Ω) is specified as a level 2, and the Δ BI value equal to or smaller than 1/3 of the reference value (10 Ω) becomes as a level 3 specified. This means that the higher level implies the higher probability of development. As emphasized above, as the higher reference BI value can be selected for the woman, the elderly, and the subject having more relevancy factors involved in the lower leg thrombosis of the lower leg, this high set score may not be easy should be exceeded and, accordingly, the certain level and  Thus, the level indicative of the likelihood of genesis will be higher for these subjects in this category, even with the same Δ BI in the measured result. The ad4indicates the level representing the specific result (step S18).  Then the subject can print the particular result and message on a sheet of paper. When the pressure switch5fis pressed (step S20), the printer performs6the printing operation and ejects the printed sheet of paper (step S21). After completion of the printing operation or after a predetermined period of time in a case of non-pressing of the pressure switch5fhas passed, the indication of the advertisement disappears4to complete the whole process of actuation and the power or the current is also switched off. In the first embodiment, which does not form part of the invention and as discussed above is the determination regarding the state of the deviation The values of bioelectrical impedance have been made before and after the change of position The determination of the value of the bioelectric Impedance can be given only once after the change in position was measured. In this case, after a predetermined Time of a restriction the movements of the lower leg, followed by the movement, which the muscular Pumping effect can be effective or effective, the value of the bioelectric Impedance is measured, and the value thus measured is compared with the reference value for the ordinary compared to a healthy person, thereby enabling the determination. By doing now to an embodiment of the present invention, such a device describing a provision relating to the condition thrombosis of deep-seated veins, based on a blood transfusion and a storage capacity, caused by the gradient of bioelectrical impedance or induced, as previously discussed. 6FIG. 14 is a diagram for illustrating a principle of determination by using the deviation in the bioelectrical impedance value in connection with the change of posture or posture change, as shown in FIG1is shown. Assuming that a gradient of a bioelectrical impedance for the period of the first reclining position is referred to as θ1, a value of the bioelectrical impedance measured at an initial point (A1) of this period as ZA1, a value of the bioelectrical impedance measured at an end point (B1) of this period as ZB1, and a time required from A1 to B1 as T1, thenθ1 = (ZB1- ZA1) / T1 (2) Similarly, assuming that a gradient of bioelectrical impedance for the following period of the standing position is referred to as θ2, a value of bioelectrical impedance measured at an initial point (A2) of this period as ZA2, a bioelectrical impedance value measured at an end point (B2) of this period as ZB2, and a time required from A2 to B2 as T2, thenθ2 = (ZA2- ZB2) / T2 (3) Similarly, assuming that a gradient of bioelectrical impedance for the period of the last reclining position is referred to as θ3, a value of the bioelectrical impedance measured at a starting point (A3) of this period is expressed as ZA3, a value of bioelectric Impedance measured at an end point (B3) of this period as ZB3, and a time required from A3 to B3 as T3, thenθ3 = (ZB3- ZA3) / T3 (4) The thus determined θ1 and θ3 represent an amount of a body fluid flowing from the lower legs to the upper body of the body per unit time, respectively, while θ2 conversely represents an amount of a body fluid from the upper body to the upper body Lower legs per unit time flows. From these subjects or persons having the higher θ1 and θ3 values, it can be said that  they are unlikely to have the condition to allow the body fluid to be stored in the lower legs, or unlikely to allow the condition to allow the blood to be stored therein, while conversely these subjects having the higher θ2 may be said to have the condition that is appropriate to allow the body fluid to be stored in the lower legs, or the greater the likelihood to develop thrombosis of deep-seated veins. Based On such a principle, in the second embodiment the bioelectrical impedance is measured and a determination is made on the Based on the gradient or the degree of deviation thereof. Since the determination device according to the second embodiment is similar to a schematic perspective view2which is shown with reference to the first embodiment except that the seat portion thereof should be modified to allow the subject to assume the reclining position, and a block diagram thereof may also be similar to FIG3Therefore, the drawings specific to this apparatus should be omitted, but various components thereof are denoted by the same reference numerals as those in the first embodiment in the specification. 7Fig. 15 is a diagram showing a flow of an operation in the embodiment of the present invention. Therefore, since the operation from step S51 to step S58 is the same as the operation from step S1 to step S8 in the first embodiment, the explanation thereof should be omitted herein. The subject presses for completion of attaching the measuring clamps7a.7bthe decision / limit switch5e(Step S59). In response, the ad shows4""Stay calm in a reclining or lying position with your legs motionless."" on and the clock25is activated to start counting a predetermined period of time. In this embodiment, the clock counts for five minutes (step S60). Thereafter, the device starts to measure a bioelectrical impedance of the subject (step S61). A calculated bioelectrical impedance value is stored in the memory unit24stored (step S62). Then, it is checked whether the five-minute period has passed or not (step S63), and if not, the process returns to step S61 to continue measuring the bioelectrical impedance. Since the body orientation of the subject has been changed from the standing or sitting position to the reclining position, the body fluid stored in the lower legs may move into the upper body of the body during this period. Therefore, the value of the bioelectrical impedance measured between both feet can gradually increase, as represented by a curve on the left side of FIG1is shown. This is based on the fact that the blood contains much electrolyte, such as sodium ion (Na +) and potassium ion (K +), and thus has a higher conductive property, and when the amount of blood is reduced, then should the impedance value in this range will increase accordingly. At step S63, if the five-minute interval has passed, then an indication to instruct the subject to get up is displayed4appear (step S64). In response, the subject himself puts himself in the standing position and presses the decision / limit switch5e(Step S65). Then the display shows4the instruction, ""Stay in place with your feet motionless."" and the clock25is activated again to start counting for another specific period of time. The clock25counts at this time for five minutes (step S66). Thereafter, the device starts to measure the bioelectrical impedance of the subject (step S67). The calculated value of bioelectrical impedance is in the memory unit24stored (step S68). Then, it is checked whether the five-minute interval has passed or not (step S69), and if not, the process returns to step S67 to continue measuring the bioelectrical impedance. Since the body direction of the subject has been changed from the reclined position to the standing position, the body fluid containing the blood that is circulated throughout the body will begin to be stored in the lower legs. Therefore, the value of the bioelectrical impedance measured between both feet is gradually reduced as shown by the curve in the middle portion of FIG1will be shown. Initially, the bioelectrical impedance drops rapidly and then shows a gradual decrease as the amount of blood in the lower legs approaches the limit of storage capacity. If the five-minute interval has passed at step S69, an indication to instruct the subject to self-rest on the  display4shown (step S70). In response, the subject puts himself in the reclined position and presses the decision / limit switch5e(Step S71). Then the display shows4the statement ""Stay calm in the reclining or lying position with your legs motionless."" on and the clock25is activated to begin counting for another particular period of time. The clock25counts at this time for five minutes (step S72). Thereafter, the device starts to measure the bioelectrical impedance of the subject (step S73). The calculated value of bioelectrical impedance is in the memory unit24stored (step S74). Then, it is checked whether the five minute interval has passed or not (step S75), and if not, the process returns to step S74 to continue measuring the bioelectrical impedance. Since the body direction of the subject has been changed from the standing position to the reclining position, the body fluid including the blood stored in the lower legs may begin to move back into the upper body. Therefore, the value of the bioelectrical impedance measured between both feet gradually increases as shown by the curve on the right side of FIG1will be shown. If the five-minute interval has passed at step S75, the measurement of the bioelectric ends Impedance and an arithmetic operation will begin (step S76). In this arithmetic operation, the gradient of a bioelectrical impedance represented by the deviation thereof per unit time is determined for each period of a specific body direction. The θ1, θ2 and θ3 can be calculated from the bioelectrical impedance values, each being measured at the initial moment in each period of the specific body direction (ZA1, ZA2, ZA3) as well as the bioelectrical impedance values, each in the last moment in each period (ZB1, ZB2, ZB3) and the measuring times (T1, T2, T3) are measured by using the above equations (2) - (4). Thus, the calculated θ1, θ2, and θ3 are compared with corresponding reference values included in the memory unit24whereby it is determined whether or not the subject has the condition suitable for developing thrombosis of deep-seated veins. For the purpose of the present invention, the term, respectively corresponding reference values, refers to the gradients of bioelectrical impedance represented by the deviations thereof per unit time for a common healthy person in respective periods of particular body directions. The reference values similar to those in the first embodiment may be modified depending on the sex, the age, or the degree of relevance of a subject regarding the factors involved in the lower leg thrombosis of lower leg veins, and hence the memory unit24a plurality of reference values are stored for each period of a particular body orientation. If the thus calculated θ1 or θ3 is lower than its reference value and θ2 is greater than its reference value, which has a larger storage capacity in the Indicating lower legs, then it can be said that the subject has the condition that is suitable thrombosis of low-lying veins to develop. Consequently, the comparisons of the gradients of the three impedances performed to see if the θ1 and θ3 fallen to or lower than the reference levels or not, and if the θ2 fallen or greater than the reference value or not, and it determines how far the conditions have been met are, in which case all fulfilled three conditions are, then as a level 0, in the event that one of the conditions is not Fulfills is, then as a level 1, in the event that two of the conditions are not Fulfills are, as a level 2, and in the case that all three states are not Fulfills are when a level 3 is specified. The ad4indicates the level representing the specific result (step S77). Farther becomes a communication or advice regarding the procedure for preventing the development of thrombosis of low-lying veins a lower leg also displayed (step S78). This advice can include those described with reference to the first embodiment previously presented and are thus omitted herein. Then the subject can print the particular result and advice on a sheet of paper. When the pressure switch5fis pressed (step S79), the printer performs6the printing operation by and ejects the printed sheet of paper (step S80). After completion of the printing operation or after a predetermined period of time in the case of non-pressing of the pressure switch5fhas passed, the display disappears on the display4to stop the whole process of the operation, and the power or the power is also turned off. Some of the preferred embodiments of the present invention were as described above, but wherein the reference value of the bioelectrical impedance (reference BI), which in the description of the first embodiment is shown, has been used only by way of example and the reference BI may be suitably modified, in addition to the Gender and age, a set of personal physical information, like a body fat ratio or a BMI (body mass index). This is based on the fact that from a fatigued subject, that a relatively larger fat mass typically smaller muscle mass and inevitably have a worse ability to pump the muscular action effective or effective. Furthermore may, although in the illustrated embodiments, the reference has been described in the storage unit in a kind or to be stored in a mode consisting of a plurality of values exists, a similar one Effect can be obtained in an alternative way of the reference value, in which a reference value can be stored in response on the entered personal physical information to be modified, creating a provision to disposal or otherwise instead of modifying the Reference value may be a measured value of bioelectrical impedance in response to the personal corrected physical information and the corrected bioelectric Impedance and the corrected value of the bioelectrical impedance compared with the reference value, whereby a determination of the state or status available is provided. Furthermore can, though the period for restricting the movement of the legs before the measurement as a five-minute interval in the Embodiments illustrated above has been set, the restriction period is made longer so that more Blood can be stored in the lower legs, which is a more accurate or more careful Determination allows whether or not the subject has the condition suitable for thrombosis low-lying veins develop in the area of the lower leg. However, it is not good for either the body of the subject, that some Genuine thrombus by prolonged limitation of the legs in adverse Manner is generated, and so should an appropriate or appropriate Time period can be adjusted by exhaustion or fatigue or Pain of the subject as well as a comfort considered become. Furthermore may, although in the embodiment illustrated above, a configuration has been used, in which the measuring clamp with the electrode are provided to the ankle area as a means for To be attached to bioelectrical impedance measurement an adhesive electrode can be used which directly close to the skin of the ankle area can be attached, or an alternative configuration can be used in which an electrode on a surface of the measuring unit may be arranged on which to arrange a foot of a subject is, so that one Sole of a foot can come into contact with it, reducing the measurement of bioelectric Impedance is allowed. Furthermore can, although in the above illustrated embodiment, the bioelectric Impedance between one and the other foot has been measured, one such impedance is measured by using only a single foot to determine whether he / she is in or out of condition, to develop thrombosis of deep-seated veins. In such a Case it becomes possible be able to make such a decision by, for example, Electrodes on the ankle area and the knee or thigh of a single leg, to measure the bioelectrical impedance between them. Furthermore is, although the state or status of the subject, that it is unlikely is to develop the thrombosis of low-lying lower leg veins, by levels such as the specific result in the above embodiments, is displayed, the display of the specific result is not limited to this but can be expressed by% or by expressions such as For example ""Normal"", ""Be careful"" or ""Caution Required"" represents become. Farther can from the point of view that the Standby time until execution the measurement of bioelectrical impedance both before the change of posture or change of position in the first embodiment as well as the time period of the reclining ones or lying position in the second embodiment as annoying for the subject be considered when such a configuration is used or which is an index concerning a body structure, like the body fat ratio or the body water content, which are calculated from the bioelectrical impedance value can, allowed, for the subject during the above time period and displayed, then the device be more comfortable, so that Subject would not be particularly sensitive to the wait. In addition, when the determination based on the difference between the values of the bioelectrical impedance, which are respectively measured before and after a change in position, such as  this is shown in the first embodiment, is combined with the determination based on the gradient of a bioelectrical impedance for a period of a certain body orientation, as shown in the second embodiment, to provide the device, the determination by using of two indices, then provide a more accurate determination as to whether or not the subject has the condition suitable for developing thrombosis of deep-seated veins. EFFECT OF INVENTION With the device for the determination of thromboses of deep-seated veins of the present invention, which has been configured to determine whether a subject has the state or status or not that is capable of thrombosis of low-lying veins in the area of the lower leg, the subject can develop his / her own Recognize condition in a simple manner. Furthermore can, as the device for the determination of low-lying veins according to a embodiment, which does not form part of the invention, the bioelectrical values Impedance before and after a change in position the posture measure and then determine from the deviation of whether one Subject having or not having the condition that is suitable for thrombosis develop low-lying veins, therefore this provision to a Time of a real circumstance or event of a blood transfer be given by the muscular pumping action of the subject which can directly influence the development of the thrombus, and hence the determination can be more accurate. Furthermore can, as the device for the determination of thrombosis low-lying Veins according to one embodiment, which does not form part of the present invention, the gradient a bioelectrical impedance can be determined by a deviation thereof represented per unit time becomes, after a subject body orientation, for example, from a reclining Position in a standing position, has changed, and then based on the value of the gradient can determine if the subject is the state or not, which is suitable for deep thrombosis To develop veins, therefore, the determination on a blood storage capacity in the area of the lower leg and therefore the determination of whether the subject has or does not have the condition that is suitable To develop thrombosis of low-lying veins of the lower leg, be more specific. Furthermore can, as the device for the determination of thrombosis low-lying Veins of the present invention have a reference choose can that for a determination based on the personal physical information for a Subject is suitable, therefore provided a more accurate determination whether or not the subject has the condition capable or not susceptible is to develop the thrombosis of low-lying veins of the lower leg. Yet Further, since the device for the determination of thrombosis deeper Veins of the present invention modify the reference value can order for the determination based on the degree of relevance of the subject to the factors which is considered to be used in thrombosis low-lying veins of the lower leg to be involved, therefore a more specific provision will be made available if that Subject having the condition or not suitable for the thrombosis low-lying veins of the lower leg to develop.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1represents the schematic of a single-beam echosounder, in which an acoustic transducer [1] mounted below a research vessel [2], sends acoustic impulses to the seafloor in a direction perpendicular to the sea level, and receives the echo scattered back from the seafloor. The ship moves along a given pre-planned path, wherein a series of successive echoes scattered back from successive segments on the seabed are received by in-board receiver hardware and recorded in its data storage module as a time-series record , A disadvantage of this single-beam echosounder is that the coverage area of the seabed achievable in this manner is limited to the footprint of a single acoustic beam impinging on the seabed. 2provides the schematic of a multi-beam echosounder [3], which is used for simultaneous mapping of the seabed over large areas. In this geometry, the transducers are spaced in such a manner as to provide overlapping seabed coverage. The fan-beam type acoustic system consists of a linear array of transducers located below the hull [4] are mounted. This fan-beam type echosounder system basically consists of two main subsystems, namely an acoustic subsystem [5] and a data processing subsystem [6]. The acoustic subsystem has a linear array of transducers that are under a particular, suitable, angular  Separation are installed, cable junction boxes, a field of transceiver systems for the respective converter field and usually a rattle tamping lift sensor for input to the online processing system. The data processing control system employs a marine computer, data storage devices, and so forth. The multi-beam echo sounder is a device that provides higher resolution mapping of the marine bed. This system is capable of achieving greater coverage, as well as producing a card with high precision. The use of the multi-beam echosounding system results in the production of seabed profiles correlated to a single, central lane and allows more reliable correlation of intersecting lanes. 312 shows a schematic representation of the beam configuration of the multi-beam echosounder used as part of the novel system of the present invention for a classification of the seabed using a Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) layout using unprocessed multi-beam backscatter Data consisting primarily of two identical fields [7] and [8th] acoustic transducer, mounted at right angles to each other, consists. Each field is a combination of several subfields [7.1], ... [7.n] and [8.1], ... [8.n.], each one consisting of a plurality of elements. These elements form a set of channels [9.1], [9.2], ... [9.n.], where each channel consists of a group of elements in series. Similarly, for another counterpart converter field, the receive channels [10.1], [10.2], ... [10.n]. Since both fields are identical, they can be used for either sending or receiving. In the receive mode, signals from different channels are pre-amplified, corrected for attenuation, and then a beamform is performed using appropriate delays. Overall, a fixed number of preformed steels (pfb) are formed within a strip of 90 °. The rays are evenly spaced (~ 1.5 °), with average beam widths ranging from 1.5 ° to 2.3 ° for deep sea surveys. The half power beam width becomes about twice as fast when operating the system in a shallow water mode. The beamformed outputs are tapped at the bottom echo module to estimate the depth corresponding to the beams from different directions. To achieve uniform insonification across a 90 ° stripe, the system is designed to operate in a swath mode. 412 shows a schematic block diagram of the signal processing hardware used for steel forming the backscattered signal sequence, which consists primarily of a preamplifier.11], a time-varying gain adjustment circuit [12], a beam former [13], a digital-to-analog converter [14], a filter [15], an analog-to-digital (A / D) converter [16], a ground tracking gate [bottom guide opening] [17], an ad [18] consists. The digital data used for seabed classification is taken from the output channel of the A / D converter [16] derived. This signal becomes an rms estimation module [19] whose outputs are used as the input vectors for further processing. 5FIG. 12 illustrates the schematic block diagram of the hybrid ANN layout used in the system of the present invention. This layout consists of a self-organizing map SOM network [20], a learning vector quantization variant 1 (LVQ1) [21] and the memory / display module [22]. The input to the SOM network [20] is determined by the output of the rms estimation module [19] derived. In the system of the present invention, the SOM network receives [20] the unprocessed multi-beam backscatter rms data (the pattern of which is the enveloping rms signal amplitude versus the beam number in the cross-track direction) obtained from the different preformed beams and classifies the seabed data into different roughnesses types. The different roughness types are differentiated based on the ship's lane-angle multi-beam signal backscatter shape parameter. Each cluster thus formed represents a unique pattern of the input data. Accordingly, the number of clusters formed is equal to the number of differing patterns of the received seabed record. These clusters are formed with the SOM network's own unmonitored learning feature without any prior knowledge of the number of different types of input patterns. The clusters of the dataset generated by the SOM [20] are added to the LVQ1 [21] entered. The non-perfect classification given to the SOM network [20] due to the nature of the unattended learning, without any background knowledge (of the input data types), is partly due to the LVQ1 network [21] eliminated. This improvement in the classification of the seafloor results from the supervised learning, based on the feedback contributed to the LVQ1 network [21] is delivered by the interpreter in the form of a person, judged by the ground truth record. The enhancement is based on the ""reward punishment"" criterion, where a correctly representing weighting vector is created to better match the input, while a misrepresentation weighting vector is away from the input  is moved so that it will avoid misclassification in future comparisons. The LVQ1 [21] works more efficiently at the central area of the weighting distribution of each cluster formed in the SOM [20], as the end of the distribution due to the inability of the LVQ1 [21] to distinguish the overlapping ends of adjacent clusters. The outputs of the LVQ1 [21] are subsequently added to the storage and display module [22], where an interpreter in the form of a person may make use of the results indicated to make further judgments about the quality of a classification. 6FIG. 12 illustrates the schematic block diagram of an alternative hybrid ANN layout used in the system of the present invention along with the layout described in FIG5is shown is used. This layout is similar to the one in5the only difference being that while the LVQ1 [21] misclassification to a greater extent at the central area of the weighting distribution of each cluster formed in the SOM [20], as avoids at the rear of the distribution, the LVQ2 network focuses on minimizing the misclassification (which arises in SOM) as a consequence of the ability to distinguish the overlapping ends of the weighting distribution of adjacent clusters. The LVQ2 [23] employs a technique for redistributing the weights of the overlapping regions of the adjacent clusters to the respective parent clusters. The outputs of the LVQ2 [23] are subsequently added to the memory and display module [22], where the results are displayed and stored to allow an interpreter in the form of a person to make further judgments about the quality of the classification. 7FIG. 12 depicts the schematic block diagram of an improved hybrid ANN layout used in the system of the present invention along with the layout incorporated in FIGS5and6is shown used. This layout has the advantage of performing a seabed classification based on the different capabilities of LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23] to thereby obtain the best possible classification considering the central as well as the rear of the weighting distributions in the process of classification. 8threpresents the clustering of the vectors of unprocessed data resulting in the SOM network specified above [20] and the features of supervised learning by LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23], both independently and combined with each other. In this illustration, two weighting vectors arranged on each side of the boundary (shown as a thick vertical line) have been given to lie within the overlapping area of adjacent clusters. In the presentation of the8thput the segments [24.1], [24.2] and [24.3] three consecutive weight distribution patterns [24represented by the unmonitored SOM [20], where the symbols (•), (|), and (/) indicate three different classes of roughness parameters of the seabed. As a representative example, the weight distribution pattern [25] at the output of the LVQ1 [21] of the monitored architecture significantly removes the central, misclassified areas (•) of [24.1] and [24.2], and their further development into the parent cluster, represented by the segment [24.3], thereby improving the redistribution in segments [25.1], [25.2] and [25.3] of the full weight distribution pattern [25] to achieve. The weight distribution pattern [26]represents the effectiveness of LVQ2 [23] of the monitored layout, with the segments [26.1], [26.2] and [26.3] removing the vector (/) of the misclassified data from the back of [24.1] and [24.3] of the SOM output [24] and its further development to its parent segment [24.2], as shown in [26] while the classification error in the central areas of the weight distribution pattern in [26.1], indicated by (•), is ignored. The weight distribution pattern [27] represents the effectiveness of a classification with the combined use of LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23], with the misclassifications occurring both in the central and in the back of [24are corrected to provide a fully corrected weight distribution pattern [27] to obtain. 9provides a table of roughness parameters and classification results (in percentages) for three areas of a seabed, tested using LVQ1, LVQ2, and a combination of both the above-monitored layouts, using SOM as the preprocessor in each case, represents. Generally, in the hydrosweep multi-beam echosounding system, the two outboard port and starboard side outboard beam blanks are faulty and neglected. As a result, the original input beam vector of 59 becomes a field of 55 beam values from an angle of -45 ° to + 45 °. In this embodiment, each of the 55 beam values for 5 input vectors is averaged at a time for smoothing the input vector. By reducing variations in the input patterns from the same seabed area, one can obtain a slightly improved classification operation, albeit at the cost of computation time  th. The preprocessor block uses unmonitored learning to form a self-organized mapping of 100 input vectors from different seabeds. The input data vectors are converted from the decibel scale to their natural values. Each vector is then normalized to adjust the range of weights. The data is still unprocessed in the sense that no preprocessing algorithm (PROBASI) has been applied to it. From each seabed area, a respective backscatter record is selected for training the SOM network. In this architecture, neighboring entities, referred to as neurons, compete with each other through the mutual, lateral interaction of their weights. The weights in the neighborhood of the nearest matching neuron to the input vector given are updated from an initial random distribution so as to bring them closer to that input vector. This leads to the formation of local neighborhoods, indicating a particular class. The learning rate is an exponential decreasing function 0.5 / (t0.2), where t is the number of iterations, thus causing the rate of weighting to be updated to be high initially, and then gradually for finer tuning in subsequent iterations until finally only one neuron emerges in response to an input being delivered. At the end of the execution of the SOM algorithm, the input space aligns into coarse clusters, each representing a unique input pattern, without any a priori information. Future input vectors provided in the test phase are assigned to a cluster in the output space that best fits the input vector. The power-law parameters (gamma and beta) for the different seabed areas, obtained through physical modeling, are used to correlate the results obtained. The trained weighting matrix, after the SOM network has been set up, as the inputs for a supervised, learning network, namely LVQ, used. This is a training and testing simultaneously for a few iterations performed, until the network weights that belong to each cluster really for this Cluster representative are. The learning rate is still exponential, but with a lot smaller initial value, to a fine tuning of neuron weights to enable. In LVQ1, under the control of the user, for 3-4 input vectors from each class, the incorrectly classified weighting vector moved away from the entrance. If the classification is correct, the weighting vector is amplified toward the input and a final misclassification will result in further testing avoided. LVQ2 goes a step further to the overlapping ones Weighting biases in areas of crossover from neighboring ones Clusters by applying the window function to their boundary for a correction on 1-2 Overcome neurons. The window will be in half subdivided and corrections are made only if that highlighted neuron falls on the wrong side of the midplane, namely by moving the vector away from the entrance and by simultaneously Bring the neuron closer to the correct half of the window. An expression is taken from the probability density function (pdf) of the highlighted neuron versus the frequency of the excitation performed. In particular, three seabed areas A, B and C are used for the comparative study here. The results of the classification are tabulated in9specified for SOM, LVQ1, and LVQ2 for unprocessed backscatter data. Comparing the tabulated Power Law parameters (gamma and beta), which act as an indicator of seabed interface roughness, with self-organized clusters after training by SOM, it has been found that the ranges A and C are of the same type of seabed. Between the two, the classification results indicated increased functionality with LVQ for region C, which is rougher, as indicated by its higher Chrαvalue (rms roughness between two points separated by a distance of 100 m). The most significant contribution of this invention is the ability of the network to provide excellent response to unprocessed data, thereby eliminating the need for lengthy preprocessing of the multi-beam backscatter data for sea floor roughness theory, thereby providing an on-line display of the ocean floor roughness Roughness, just using rough data to deliver.
