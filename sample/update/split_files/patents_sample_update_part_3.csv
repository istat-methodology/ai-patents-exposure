DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In1is at100a typical environment for a diagnostic device according to an embodiment of the invention shown. In1is a diagnostic device, such as a process transducer configured as a pressure transducer102than with the control system104shown connected. Process transducers may be configured to monitor one or more process variables used in connection with fluids in a process plant, such as sludges, liquids, vapors and gases in chemical, pulp, petroleum, gas, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries other liquid processing equipment. The monitored process variables can be pressure, flow, level, temperature, or other properties of liquids. A vibration sensitive process variable sensor is a sensor that can detect vibrations transmitted in the process fluid, such as a pressure sensor, a sensor in a Coriolis flowmeter, electrodes in a magnetic flowmeter, a sensor in a vortex or ultrasonic flowmeter, or the like. Process transmitters include one or more sensors, which may be located either inside or outside the transmitter, depending on the installation requirements of the process equipment. Process transducers generate one or more transmitter outputs that represent a sensed process variable or that can also monitor the process using data received from remote sensors. Transmitter outputs are for transmission over long distances to a controller or display over the communication bus106configured. Usually, they are in fluid processing systems in the communications bus 106 to a 4-20 mA current loop that powers the transmitter, or a fieldbus connection, a communication according to a HART®protocol or a fiber optic connection to a controller, a control system or an output device. For transducers powered by a two-wire loop, the power must be kept low to ensure intrinsic safety in potentially explosive atmospheres. Other types of communication buses may also be used, such as an eithernet operated with other protocols such as TCP / IP. In1are the pump control device108and the valve control device110as examples of control devices and vibration noise sources. Control devices are provided by the control system104using the communication bus106triggered to control the process fluid. In the system104it may be a maintenance computer, a business planning or monitoring system or a computerized maintenance measurement system or a process control system. Control devices are also typical vibration noise sources. However, a vibration sound source is any element in a process that generates vibrations transmitted from the process fluid. Vibratory noise signals are any vibration signal generated by a controller or generated by the process fluid flowing through the process system, such as vibrations due to cavitation or other noise associated with the flow or process. The valve control device110includes a valve control112which supplies a supply of compressed air to the valve actuator114which in turn monitors the valve116triggers. The pump control  direction includes an engine118who is the pump120drives to process fluid through the intake flange line122through and through the drain valve124to move out. Control devices and transducers all couple to the process piping130transporting process fluid. Vibration noise signals132generated by the method, such as the operation of control devices, propagate through the process fluid and are detected by a process variable sensor. In2a block diagram illustrates one embodiment of a transmitter102which is configured according to the invention as a diagnostic device. Examples of other diagnostic devices include the control system104, the magnetic flow meter250(7), the vortex flowmeter260(8th) and the Coriolis flowmeter330(9). The transmitter102detected with the process variable sensor138a process variable of the process fluid in the pipe130, The transmitter102includes a process coupling132, which is a process variable sensor138with the process liquid in the pipe130coupled. The coupling132can, for example, impulse lines136and the flange140for the transmitter102, the flow tube252for the magnetic flow meter150, the flow tube264and the detachment bar262for the vortex flowmeter160, or the flow tube332and the gauges336for the Coriolis flowmeter330exhibit. Examples of process variable sensors include a pressure sensor, electrodes258(7), Sensor266(8th), and coils342(9). The analog-to-digital converter144receives the sensor input146from the process variable sensor138supplied with a process variable of the process liquid. The analog-to-digital converter144puts the microprocessor system148a digitized sensor signal ready. The microprocessor system148includes a signal preprocessor150that's about the analog-to-digital converter144with the sensor input146is coupled and signal components in the sensor signal, such as frequencies, amplitudes or signal characteristics associated with the operation of the method isolated. The signal preprocessor150provides the signal evaluator154an isolated signal output152ready. The signal preprocessor isolates a portion of the process variable signal by filtering, performing wavelet transformation, performing a Fourier transform, using a neural network, statistical analysis, or other signal evaluation techniques. The isolated signal output is related to vibration noise signals132in the from the sensor138recorded process fluid. The signal evaluator154includes a memory155and provides a status output156ready, which is associated with a state of the procedure. The signal evaluator154evaluates the isolated signal output152based on a rule, a ""fuzzy logic"", a neural network, an expert system, a wavelet analysis or other signal evaluation methods. The process states include condition, diagnostics, health, or information about the time to failure of valves, pumps, pump seals, deflation systems, actuators, solenoids, compressors, turbines, agitators, dampers, tubing, fixtures, containers, and other components of a process control system. The signal preprocessor150and the signal evaluator154isolate sensor signal components and evaluate them as in the flow chart200from6shown off. The microprocessor system148Further, according to known methods, calculates a process variable based on the sensor signal input146, One with the microprocessor system148coupled digital-to-analog converter158generates an analog transmitter output160for coupling to the communication bus106, A digital communication circuit162generates a transmitter output164, The analog output160and the diagnostic data164can be coupled with displays or controls as needed. The signal preprocessor150is configured to isolate signal components that are vibration noise signals132in the process fluid are associated. The signal components are isolated by signal processing techniques which identify only desired frequencies or other signal characteristics, such as amplitude, and an indication of their identification is on an isolated signal output152provided. Depending on the strength of the noise signals132and its frequency, the signal preprocessor may use a filter, such as a bandpass filter, to produce the isolated signal output152exhibit. For more accurate isolation, more advanced signal processing techniques such as fast Fourier transform (FFT) are used to obtain the spectrum of the sensor signal. In a preferred embodiment, the signal preprocessor150a wavelet processor that works like in3.4and5illustrated using a discrete wavelet transform performs a wavelet analysis of the sensor signal. Wavelet analysis is well-suited for analyzing signals that have transient or other non-stationary time domain properties. In contrast to the Fourier transformation, the wavelet analysis stores information in the time domain, ie  when the event took place. The Wavelet analysis is a method of converting a time domain signal in the frequency domain, which is like a Fourier transform a Identification of the frequency components allows. Unlike one Fourier transform involves the output in a wavelet transform however time-related information. This can take the form of a three-dimensional Diagram in which the time on one axis, the frequency on a second axis and the signal amplitude on a third axis is shown. When performing a continuous Wavelet transformation becomes part of the sensor signal with windows provided and folded with a wavelet function. This folding is by overlay the wavelet function is performed at the beginning of a sample, and by multiplying the wavelet function by the signal and the result then over the sample duration is integrated. The result of integration is scaled and represents the first value of the continuous wavelet transform This point can then be on a zero Three-dimensional plane to be mapped. The wavelet function is then shifted to the right (forward in time) and the multiplication and integration steps are repeated to another sentence to get from data points mapped to the 3D area become. This process is repeated and the wavelet is passed through the entire signal moves (folded). The wavelet function then becomes scaled, which alters the frequency resolution of the conversion, and the ones mentioned above Steps are repeated. Data from a wavelet transformation of a sensor signal from the process variable sensor138are in3shown. The data is plotted in three dimensions to form an area170, As in the diagram of3is shown, includes the sensor signal due to the vibration noise signal132a small signal peak at about 1 kHz at time t1and another peak at about 100 Hz at time t2. By subsequent processing by the signal evaluator154be the area170or parts of the area170evaluated to a state issue156provide. The continuous wavelet transformation described above requires detailed calculations. Thus, the signal preprocessor performs150in one embodiment, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) suitable for implementation in the microprocessor system148is well suited. An efficient discrete wavelet transform uses the Mallat algorithm, which is a two-channel subband coder. The Mallat algorithm provides a series of separated or split signals indicating individual frequency components of the original signal.4FIG. 10 illustrates an example of such a system in which an original sensor signal S is decomposed using a subband coder of a Mallat algorithm. The signal S has a frequency range between 0 and a maximum of fMAX. The signal is simultaneously passed through a first high pass filter with a frequency range between 1/2 fMAXand fMAXand a low pass filter with a frequency range between 0 and 1/2 fMAX. This process is called decomposition. The output of the high-pass filter represents discrete wavelet transform coefficients of the ""stage1""ready. The coefficients of the stage1provide the amplitude as a function of the time of the portion of the input signal that is between 1/2 fMAXand fMAX. The output of the 0-1 / 2 fMAXlow pass filter is passed through successive high pass (1/4 fMAX- 1/2 fMAX) and low pass (0-1 / 4 fMAX) filters as required to provide additional Steps (above ""Level1The outputs of each low-pass filter may be subjected to further decompositions as needed, providing additional levels of discrete wavelet transform coefficients, and this process continues until the desired resolution is achieved or the number of decays is exceeded The resolution of the wavelet transform is selected to be approximately equal to that of the sensor or the same as the minimum signal resolution necessary to produce the vibration noise signal132to monitor. Each level of the DWT coefficients indicates a signal amplitude as a function of time for a given frequency range. Coefficients for each frequency range are connected to an in3to form a diagram. In some embodiments, padding is added to the signal by adding data to the sensor signal near the boundaries of windows used in the wavelet analysis. This padding reduces distortion in the time domain output. This method can be used with a continuous wavelet transform or a discrete wavelet transform. Padding is defined to add additional data on each page of the currently active data window, for example adding additional data points that extend 25% beyond the current window over both window boundaries. In one embodiment, the padding is generated by repeating part of the data in the current window so that the added data ""bolsters"" the existing signal on both sides. The entire record is then converted into a square glide  which is used to extrapolate the signal by 25% beyond the active data window. 5is an example that one of the sensor138generated signal S and the resulting approximate signals in seven levels of resolution, by stage1to level7are numbered. In this example, the signal level indicates7the lowest frequency DWT coefficient that can be generated. Any further decomposition leads to noise. All stages, or just the stages, the vibration noise signals132are concerned, the signal evaluator154as isolated signal152provided. Depending on the particular system configuration and type of sensor, for example, the stages2.3and5that the signal evaluator154provided isolated signal152include. The signal evaluator154evaluates that from the signal preprocessor150received isolated signal152In one embodiment, it monitors and monitors an amplitude of a particular frequency or frequency range that is in the isolated signal152has been identified, and provides the status output156ready if a threshold is exceeded. If the isolated signal152For example, these components of the sensor signal between 45 and 55 Hz, the Sensorauswerter154the status output156provide, when a threshold is exceeded, a state in the process, such as a bearing failure in a pump control device108or cavitation in the valve control device110indicates. The signal evaluator may further include more advanced decision making algorithms, such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, expert systems, rule-based systems, etc. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application 08 / 623,569 describes various systems for making decisions, in the signal evaluator154can be implemented, and to which content is referred. In6Ais a flowchart180of a diagnostic procedure performed in a diagnostic device capable of receiving a process variable. The algorithm starts at182and a process variable sensor signal is obtained. The process noise signal present in the process variable signal is included184isolated. Next, the isolated process noise signal is included186is evaluated and an output indicating the process state is included188provided in response to the evaluated isolated process noise signal.6Bis a more detailed flow chart200of the diagnostic procedure. The algorithm starts at202and a process variable sensor signal is obtained. The components X1, X2, X3, X4, ... XNare included204isolated. (For simplicity, the flowchart represents200only 4 components X1-X4). If no components X1-XNare present, the control becomes block202passed on and the process variable sensor signal is obtained again. at206.208.210.212the isolated components X1, X2, X3and X4 areoutput. Each output indicates the presence of a particular signal component in the process variable sensor signal. The isolated components are included214.216.218and 220 evaluated. In the in6The signal evaluation shown uses a rule in which the isolated signal component is compared with a limit value (limit value1, limit value2, limit value3or limit value4). If none of the limits have been exceeded by the corresponding isolated signal, the algorithm will increase202back to get an updated process variable signal. If any limit is exceeded, the algorithm assists with the output of state1, state2, state3,and state4,respectively222.224.226respectively.228further. The component X2may have, for example, signal components of the process variable sensor signal between 45 and 55 Hz. If these components have a signal strength that is greater than the limit set by limit2, state2 isoutput, which may indicate that, for example, a pump is failing in the process. Likewise, other components in the sensor signal indicate the state of other aspects of the process control system. If a single component indicates a state of more than one aspect of the method, the output indicates that there are two possible states in the method. Furthermore, the state output is not necessarily tied to a specific malfunction and may simply indicate that a particular signal component has exceeded a threshold or some other characteristic. In general, the steps become202-212from the signal preprocessor150from2and the steps214-226from the signal analyzer154carried out. However, the steps of isolation and evaluation may be combined and performed simultaneously or from the same components in a diagnostic device. For example, in process control systems where there is a known process variance due to certain process activities, the deviation to obtain the isolated sensor signal may be modeled and thus removed from the process variable signal. In one aspect, the wavelet transform data is computed during normal operation of the method and stored in memory155of in2illustrated signal evaluator154saved. These data represent a reference ""level"" of the Nor  The data may be collected at different times during the day, during a process cycle and during the year. When the signal evaluator154is used normally, it retrieves the stored wavelet transform from memory155and compares the reference plane data with information collected during operation by wavelet analysis. When the signal evaluator154For example, if the data of the reference plane is subtracted from a current wavelet transform, the resulting data only indicates the anomalies that occur during the process. Such a subtraction process separates the process variations from abnormal vibration noise signals, including the daily and seasonal deviations in the signal. The vibration sensor signal146For example, it may change during the day or during the year due to ambient temperature changes and process activities. This separates the process signal from the vibration noise signal132, In operation, a neural network in the microprocessor system148work so that it monitors the operation of the process and that in the memory155stored optimal model selects. The coefficients associated with the operation of the model could be generated using a neural network or during installation of the transmitter102over the communication bus106are received, as specified in numerous communication protocols. Examples of models include a first order model including downtime, which is usually good for non-oscillating systems, or second order models plus down time, which is usually sufficient for oscillatory operations. Another modeling technique is the use of an adaptive neural network fuzzy logic model. Such a mixing system includes a neural network and a fuzzy logic. The ""fuzzy logic"" adapts the model to the variability of the method, while the neural network models allow a flexibility of modeling in order to adapt to the changing process. This provides a relatively robust model. The use of adaptive membership functions in the model in the manner of a ""fuzzy logic"" further allows the determination of whether the particular model should be updated. The diagnostic device may operate with any suitable type of signal evaluator, such as one having a life expectancy or diagnostic circuitry. The process variable sensor138can be any type of process variable sensor capable of detecting vibrations in the process fluid. The process variable sensor should have a bandwidth and frequency response or frequency resolution sufficient to detect the desired vibration noise signals. In a differential pressure based flowmeter, this is usually between 0 and about 200 Hz. One type of process variable sensor is a pressure sensor. A process variable pressure sensor with sufficient bandwidth can be used. Other components in the devices, such as analog-to-digital converters, must also have sufficient bandwidth, amplifiers, and other elements in the input channel.7explains a magnetic flow meter250with one through the electrodes258provided process variable sensor. The flow meter250includes those with the electronics housing254coupled flow tube252, In a magnetic flow meter, coils produce256a magnetic field in the flow tube 252. The flow of the process fluid through the resulting magnetic field creates an electrical potential between the electrodes258that provide a process variable sensor signal. The vibration signals132in the liquid change the flow rate and can from the electrodes258be recorded. A typical frequency response of magnetic flowmeters is 0-75 Hz or higher. 8thexplains a vortex flowmeter260with one of the sensor266provided process variable sensor. The vortex flowmeter260includes a detachment bar262in the flow tube264attached and with a fourth sensor266is coupled. A flow of process fluid through the flow tube264initiates the detachment bar262, around the axis of rotation268to move around. This movement causes a force270on the sensor266which provides a process variable sensor signal. The frequency of this force is related to the flow through the flow tube264in connection. Noise vibration signals132are also for use with the in2illustrated signal preprocessor150and signal evaluator154to the sensor266transfer. Vortex flowmeters typically have a frequency range of between about 0 and 10 KHz or higher. 9explains one by coils342provided process variable sensor in the manner of a Coriolis flow meter330, which is a flow tube332and measuring electronics334includes. gauges336be with the flow tube332coupled. A drive coil340vibrates tubes336in response to a drive signal, and detection elements, the detection coils342as well as detection magnets344provide the resulting vibration of the tubes336associated left and right speed signals. The flow through the tubes336causes the tubes336turn in a way that's from the coils342is detected. The issues of the coils342have a relation to the flow through the tubes336and provide a process variable sensor signal. Vibration noise signals132can  also from the coils342captured and the in2illustrated signal preprocessor140to be provided. Coriolis flowmeters typically have a very wide frequency response that can detect vibrations at very high frequencies. Other types of process variable sensors include an ultrasonic or radio frequency receiver in a level gauge or an ultrasonic receiver in an ultrasonic level sensor. The transmitter102may include an ultrasonic flowmeter or a level gauge, and sensor138is an ultrasonic sensor. In addition, control devices such as valve controls may include process variable sensors. In one embodiment, the signal preprocessor generates150a sensor power signal152depending on the frequency distribution of the power of the sensor signal. The signal preprocessor150For example, it may perform a wavelet transform, discrete wavelet transform, Fourier transform, or use other methods to determine the spectrum of the sensor signal. The power of the distributed frequencies is determined by monitoring such a converted signal over time. An example of this is PSD (Power Spectral Density). The spectral power density can be determined as the power (or deviation) of a time series and can be described as the power (or deviation) of the time series is distributed with the frequency. This can be defined, for example, as the Fourier transform of an automatic correlation sequence of the time series. Another determination of the spectral power density is the square-squared Fourier transform of the time series, which is scaled by a suitable constant amount. The spectral power density Fi can also be calculated using Welch's method of averaged periodograms for a given data set. The method uses a measurement sequence x (n) sampled at fs samples per second, where n = 1, 2, ... N. A pre-filter with a filter frequency lower than fs / 2 is used to obtain the alias. To reduce effect in the spectral calculations. The data set is split into Fk, i, as shown in Equation 1: There are Fk, ioverlapping data segments, and for each data segment a periodogram is calculated where M is the number of points in the current segment. After all periodograms have been evaluated for all segments, they are all averaged to calculate the power spectrum: As soon as a range of services for a training mode is received, this sequence is stored in memory, preferably an EEPROM as a baseline power spectrum for Comparison saved with real-time power spectra. Fi is thus the power spectrum sequence and i goes from 1 to N, which is the Total number of points in the original data sequence. N, which is usually is a power of 2, also sets the frequency resolution the spectrum estimate firmly. Thus Fi is also considered the signal strength at the ith frequency known. The spectral power usually includes a large number of points at predefined frequency intervals, which is a shape determine the spectral power distribution as a function of the frequency. The signal evaluator154evaluates the signal using any suitable method and includes the methods mentioned above. The signal evaluator154For example, the frequency distribution of power in a sensor signal may be compared to a stored value, such as a stored threshold level, over a range of frequencies, for example. Other evaluation methods may be selected as needed, for example, neural networks or ""fuzzy logic"" methods may be used. The process power signal may be compared to known signal signatures and the comparison used in performing the diagnostics. Although the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention may be more in soft  be performed in any of a number of locations in a process control system, such as a field mounted device or even a system controller. Further, modern digital protocols such as a fieldbus, Profibus, and others, allow the software embodying the invention to be interchangeable between elements in a process control system, and also allow process variables to be transmitted in a transmitter and then sent to the software included in the system a different piece of equipment is arranged. For example, different functional blocks of the invention have been described in terms of circuits, but many functional blocks may be embodied in other forms such as digital and analog circuits, software and their hybrid forms. When executed in software, a microprocessor performs the functions and the signals have digital values on which the software operates. A general-purpose processor programmed with instructions that cause the processor to perform the desired process elements, application-specific hardware components that include hardwired circuitry for performing the desired elements, and any combination for programming a general-purpose processor and hardware components may be used. Deterministic or ""fuzzy logic"" methods can be used as needed to make decisions in the circuits or software. Due to the nature of complex digital circuits, circuit elements may not be divided into separate blocks as shown, but components used for different functional blocks may be mixed and used together. Likewise, in software within the scope of the invention, some instructions may be shared as part of numerous functions and mixed with unrelated instructions. A diagnostic device may be any device (or a combination of devices, such as devices that share information to come to a destination) that receives a process variable signal, and a process monitoring system, a personal computer, a control system, a portable communicator, a controller or a transmitter. A method of transmitting stored data stored in a field device and the stored data may have a higher bandwidth than would be possible if the data were transmitted at the refresh rate of the communication protocol being used may be used. Any type of process variable sensor that responds to a process noise signal may be used with the diagnostic device of the invention."

The user starts the game or another application by, for example, operating one of the possibilities of the operating device26, By actuating another possibility of the actuating device26It becomes possible to move a moving picture (player character) in a different direction or to change the view point (camera position) of the user in a three-dimensional game world. 2is a block diagram showing the electrical structure of the video game system10an embodiment of1shows. In the video game device12is a central processor unit (hereinafter referred to as ""CPU"" for short)36intended. The CPU36is also referred to as a computer or processor, etc., and is for the entire controller of the video game machine12responsible. The CPU36or the computer works as a game processor, and memory control38is via a bus with this CPU36connected. Primarily controls the memory controller38writing to or reading from main memory40which, controlled by the CPU36, also connected via a bus. To this memory controller38is a graphics processing unit (GPU)42connected. The GPU42forms part of an image calculator and is constructed, for example, as a one-chip ASIC and receives graphics commands (image computation commands) from the CPU36via the memory controller38to use a geometry unit44and an image calculation unit46to generate a three-dimensional game image according to these commands. That is, the geometry unit44performs coordinate transformation processes such as rotation, movement, deformation, etc. of the various figures and objects in a three-dimensional coordinate system composed of a plurality of polygons. In addition, the polygon is a planar polygonal surface defined by at least three vertex coordinates. The image calculation unit46performs an image-forming process, such as attaching a texture (texture image) to each polygon of the various objects, and so on. Thus, the 3D image data to be displayed on the game screen is acquired by the CPU36generated and in the image memory48calculated (saved). It should be noted that the data (basic graphic shapes or polygons or textures, etc.), which the GPU42needed to execute the graphical commands, from the main memory40via the memory controller38receives. The refresh memory48is a memory for calculating (collecting) the image data values for one frame of, for example, a glossy sample monitor34which are each one full screen from the GPU42be overwritten. As a result of a video interface to be described later58are the from the image memory48via the memory controller38read data as a 3D game image on the screen of the monitor34shown. In addition has a Z-buffer50a storage capacity equal to the number of bits of the depth data per number of pixels (memory location or address) corresponding to the frame buffer48x is a pixel and stores the depth information or depth data (Z value) of the dots corresponding to each memory location of the frame buffer48, It is noted that both the frame buffer48as well as the Z-buffer50may be constructed to be part of the main memory40use. The memory controller38is via a DSP52(digital signal processor) also with an ARAM54connected. Thus, the memory controller controls38writing and reading not only the main memory40but also the ARAM54as a sub memory. The DSP52works as a sound processor, and according to a command from the CPU36he uses in the ARAM54inscribed sound waveform data (5) so as to produce the audio corresponding to the music (sound effect), sounds or voices or music (background music) necessary for the performance of the game. Further, the memory controller38through the bus with every interface56.58.60.62and64connected. The control interface56is an interface for the control part22and attaches to the CPU36an actuating signal of the actuating device of the control part22or data about the memory controller38at. The video interface58accesses the image memory48too, reads from the GPU42generated image data and performs the image signal or the image data (digital red-green-blue pixel value) via the AC cable32(1) the monitor34to. The external storage interface60connects the memory card30(1), which in the front of the game device12is introduced with the memory controller38, This will make it the CPU36allows, via the memory controller38Data on this memory card30to write or data from this memory card30read. The audio interface62receives via the memory controller38Audio data from the DSP52or one of the optical disk18read audio stream and gives the corresponding audio signal (sound signal) to the speaker34aof the monitor34further. It is noted that in the case of a stereo sound on each of the two sides at least one speaker34ais provided. In addition, as a result of the room sound playback, it is possible to make a sound audible as if it were generated at the rear even if only two speakers are provided on both sides. Further, the disk interface provides64the connection from the disk drive16for memory control38This is what the CPU controls36the disk drive16, Program data, texture data, etc., by means of the disk drive16from the optical disk18be read, are under the control of the CPU36in the main memory40enrolled. 3shows a memory map of the main memory40, The main memory40has a program memory area70, a conductor data storage area72, a sound storage area74, a phrase memory area76, a rhythm pattern storage area78, a tag storage area80, a counter memory area82, a phrase number storage area84etc. on. In the program memory area70will that be from the optical disk18program read out all at once or partially in succession. This game program in this embodiment is a game main processing program70a, a phrase selection program70b, a rhythm selection program70c, a background music generation program70d, a background music player70e, an operation input program70f, a background music playback program70getc. built up. The Game Main Processor70ais a program for processing a main routine of the game. The phrase selection program70bis a program for random selection of phrase data from a phrase data group indicated by conductor data to be described later. The rhythm selection program70cis a program for selecting (in order or randomly) a rhythm group specified by a conductor data to be described later according to a predetermined rule. The background music generation program70dis a program for generating background music from phrase data generated by the phrase selection program70band from rhythm data generated by the rhythm selection program70cwere selected. It is noted that a variety of  Types of conductor data is formed, which will be described later, and by the game main processing program70aConductor data are selected according to the running situation of the game, etc. The background music player70eis a program for playing (playing) the background music generation program70dgenerated background music data. The operation input program70fis a program for detecting the operation input on the control part22(Actuator26) by the player. The background music playback program70gis a program for initiating a change in playing (output) of the background music according to the operation input program70fdetermined operation input, the running situation of the game or an event etc. It is noted, although not shown, that like the game program, an image processing program is also stored, and as a result of the execution of this image processing program, an image of the virtual three-dimensional space (game world) of the game is displayed on the monitor34displayed. This image concerns depictions such as the player character, the enemy character or thing (weapon, gold coin, food, equipment, medicine, etc.) or even an object such as a building, a wall, a tree, and so on. In the conductor data storage area72In this embodiment, different types of a plurality of conductor data such as data of the conductor A in FIG72a, Data of conductor B in72b, Data of conductor C in72c... saved. Here, ""conductor"" has the meaning of ""conductor (of an orchestra)"", and in this embodiment, the conductor data is data for generating the background music data. Each of these conductor records72ato72c, which will be described later, is constructed of tempo data and at least data for one track. Further, the track data is composed of data (tone group number data) indicating the number (reference number) of the program (tone), data (phrase group number data) indicating the number (reference number) of the rhythm group, etc. (see7). It is noted that this conductor data72ato72csimilar to the game program, if necessary, all at once or in part from the optical disk18getting charged. Further, in this embodiment, the sound storage area74of a plurality of memory areas, divided into each group unit, that is, a memory area740for a sound group 1 (Prog01), a memory area742for a sound group 2 (Prog02), .... Each of the storage areas740and742stores data of a number (reference numeral) which is associated with the data (tone waveform data, which will be described later) of one or more tones, as shown in FIG4 (A)is shown. It is noted that for convenience, a name (file name) of the sound waveform to be described later (see5) in4 (A)is registered. That is, in the spoke area740a program (sound) A and a program D are written, and in the memory area742a program B, a program C and the program D are written. It is noted that how it looks4 (A)is understood, within each memory area, a number of different types of sound data is written and, however, may occur in different memory areas, that a number of the same types of sound data is written. In addition will be Groups of such sounds from Developer or programmer of the game, etc. set in advance. As in54, the sound data, ie, the sound waveform data, is written in the sound waveform storage area, which is the ARAM54in this embodiment, a sub-memory of the optical disk18is. As in51, the tone waveform corresponding to one tone for each part corresponds to the tone waveform data storage area, ie. in the ARAM54is stored, for example, in principle, each a musical instrument. It should be noted that it may also be the case that a part corresponds to two or more musical instruments, such as the sound of an orchestra. More specifically, in this embodiment, the stored tone waveform data A (Prog_a)54athe sound of a piano, the sound waveform data B (Prog_b)54bthe sound of a bass (contrabass), the sound waveform data C (Prog_c)54cthe sound of a drum and the sound waveform data D (Prog_d)54dthe sound of an orchestra, etc. Although not shown, the sound waveform data of other parts are also stored. That is, the DSP52Produces audio data corresponding to the sound (tone effect), voices or music (background music) required for the game using one, two or more waveform data54a.54b.54c.54d, ... after the commands of the CPU36, to3returning is the phrase memory area76in this embodiment also from a plurality of storage areas, below  splits after each group unit, that is, a memory area760for a phrase group 1, a memory area762for a phrase group 2, ... up to a memory area770, As in4 (B)shown is each memory area760and762assigned a number (reference number) to one or a plurality of stored phrase data. As the number of phrase data stored in a region forms a group, the number of different types of phrase data having (nearly) similar musical characteristics is also stored. Here, ""with a similar musical characteristic"" means that even every phrase during a musical composition is played in the sense of disharmony or discomfort and not left out. However, for the sake of simplicity, a name (file name) of the phrase data is entered in this figure. That is, in this embodiment, a phrase A, a phrase B, a phrase C and a phrase D are in the memory area760as well as the phrase A, the phrase C and the phrase D in the memory area762stored. In addition, different types of a plurality of phrase data are stored in the phrase data memory area770saved. In this embodiment, phrase data A (Tip_a) in770a, Phrase data B (Tip_b) in770b, Phrase data C (Tip_c) in770c, Phrase data D (Tip_d) in770d, ... saved. Here, the term phrase means musical score of a part of a musical composition, and its minimal formation unit is a musical tone. More special, as in6 (A)represented, arranged in a phrase one or more musical note (s), which determine a duration and a pitch of the sound. This phrase is set in advance by a developer or game programmer. In order to describe this embodiment in more detail, the phrase corresponding to the phrase data A in FIG770ais composed of a half-note whose pitch corresponds to the musical note ""so"" when only one treble clef is specified In addition, the phrase corresponding to the phrase data B in FIG770bcorresponds to a sixteenth note, a sixteenth note, an eighth note, an eighth note, an eighth note and a quarter note, starting from the left, and the pitches of each of these notes correspond to the notes ""do"", ""re""""mi"",""so""""Si"",""mi/"" (/ means a note above an octave (perfect eight), the same applies below) and ""re /"" when only a treble clef is specified770cequals, starting from the left, an eighth note, a quarter note, an eighth note, an eighth note, a quarter note and an eighth note, and the pitches of each of these notes correspond to the notes ""so"", ""la"", ""so"", ""mi"" , ""So"" and ""mi"" if only one treble clef is specified. In addition, the phrase corresponding to the phrase data D in770dstarting from the left, a quarter note, a quarter note, a dotted quarter note (duration of a quarter note + an eighth note) of an eighth note, a quarter note and a quarter note, and the pitches of each of the notes correspond to the notes ""re /"", ""la"" , ""La"", ""so"", ""mi"" and ""so"" when the treble clef is specified. The is called, the phrase data is data regarding the musical notes of a part of the musical composition and these Data define (define) the duration of the sound as well as its pitch (musical Scale). It is noted that, as in4 (B)the reason why the phrase data is not stored directly in the memory area of the phrase group and the memory area of the phrase group and the memory area for the phrase data are separately provided is that the same phrase data may be contained even in different phrase groups, thereby preventing that the data size becomes too large. to3returning is the rhythm pattern memory area78in this embodiment, further, composed of a plurality of storage areas divided into each group unit, that is, a storage area780for a phrase group 1, a memory area782for a phrase group 2, .... In each of these memory areas, data (rhythm data) having two or more patterns is stored. More special, as in4 (C)shown in the memory area780Rhythm data A (Rhythm_a) in780a, Rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780band the same rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780bsaved. Additionally are in the memory area782Rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780b, Rhythm data A (Rhythm_a) in780a, Rhythm data C (Rhythm_c) in780c, Rhythm data D (Rhythm_d) in780das well as rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780bsaved. These rhythm data determine, based on a note, the duration of the playing (sound) for playing the phrase (data) as well as the timing of playing (playing time) and starting the playing of a phrase (data). As a result, for example, the rhythm data included in a group is sequentially or randomly selected, and the pattern (rhythm pattern) of a certain rhythmic shape is formed. In this  In particular, it can be said that the rhythm data contained in a group constitutes the rhythm pattern data. In this embodiment forms, as in6 (B)a rhythm group 1 (Rhythms01) starting from the left, the rhythm pattern from the quarter note, which the rhythm data A in780acorresponds, from the eighth note, which the rhythm data B in780bcorresponds to and from the eighth note, which the rhythm data B in780bequivalent. In the case where an order selection method is selected as the rhythm selection method, the rhythm data is selected in order from a head (starting from the left), that is, the rhythm data is selected in the order rhythm data A in780a, Rhythm data B in780b, Rhythm data B in780bis selected, and the rhythm program devised by the game programmer is thus formed. Further, if a random selection method is selected as the selection method, the three rhythm data become780a.780band780bappropriately (randomly) selected and a plurality of rhythm pattern types are formed. In a similar way, in a rhythm group 2 (Rhythms02), the rhythm pattern from the rhythm data B in780b, Rhythm data A in780a, Rhythm data C in780c, Rhythm data D in780dand the rhythm data B formed. For example, if the order selection method is selected, the rhythm data, as intended by the game programmer, is selected in order from a head, similarly to the case of the rhythm group 1. On the other hand, when the random selection method is selected, the five rhythm data become similarly as in the case of the rhythm group 1780b.780a.780c.780dand780brandomly selected and formed a variety of rhythm pattern types. It is noted that in the sound storage area74, in the phrase memory area76and in the rhythm storage area78stored data as well as the game program if necessary all at once or partially successively from the optical disk18getting charged. To3returning are in the tag memory area80a combat marker80a, a retail order mark80b, a body force reduction mark80c, a swing mark80d, a play period marker80eand a play period lock mark80fsaved. Although not shown, each of the markers80ato80fas a bit of a register. When established (on), the data value of the register is set to ""1"", and if, on the contrary, it is turned off, the value of the register is set to ""0"". The combat marker80ais a marker for determining whether a scene (fight scene) in which the player character is fighting an enemy character is turned on. In all other cases, it is turned off. The retail order mark80bis a marker to determine whether a friend figure (for example, ""PIKMIN"") accompanying the player character is equal to or smaller than a predetermined number and whether one or more character (s) are in a certain game level is dead (are). This retail order mark80bis turned on if PIKMIN is equal to or less than the predetermined number and one or more character (s) is (are) dead in the particular game level, and in all other cases is turned off. The body force reduction mark80cis a mark for determining whether the body value of the player character is equal to or smaller than a predetermined level, and is turned on when the body value of the player character is equal to or smaller than the predetermined level, and it is turned off when the body value of the player character exceeds specified level. The swing mark80dis a flag for determining whether or not to change the count tempo of the background music to be played, and is turned on in case of changing the count tempo and is turned off in case of no change of the procedure. The play period marker80eis a flag for specifying a playing period of the background music, and it is turned on if one is in a playing period of the background music, and in all other cases, it is turned off. In addition, the play period lock mark is80fa flag for specifying a play period lock of the background music, and turned on if one is in a play period lock, and in all other cases, it is turned off. In the counter memory area82a plurality of counters are provided, and in this embodiment are a rhythm step counter82a, a play period counter82ba play lock period counter82cand a phrase duration counter82dintended. Each of the counters82ato82dis constructed as a register and is used, for example, in the background music generation and playback processes to be explained later (see10to16) to be used. The phrase number storage area84is a  Area, which in the background music generation and playback processes to be explained later (see10to16) is used and stores the number (hereinafter referred to simply as phrase number) assigned to the selected phrase data when the background music data is played back. It is noted that the phrase number storage area84acan also save a name of phrase data. It is noted, though not shown, that in main memory40Image data of the above-described game world, image data of the figures, image data of an object are also stored and this image data analogous to the game program, if necessary, also in whole or in part successively from the optical disk18be downloaded. 7is an overview showing the data structure720the conductor data (72a.72b.72c, ...) shows. Referring to this7are the conductor data (72a.72b.72c, ...), as described above, composed of tempo data722and a variety of lane data726.728.730, .... The tempo data722are data for controlling the playback speed when the musical composition is played. Here, tempo is a speed at which the musical composition is played and is expressed by the number of musical sound units played per minute (bars per minute). The unit of the musical note generally uses the quarter note. However, depending on the musical composition, another musical note may be used. That is, the tempo data722are data to define (set) the speed with which this musical note is played. Consequently, if audio data for the background music according to these tempo data722are generated, for example, generates the DSP52similar to a metronome, pulse data having a high-level pulse at the timing so as to generate a click sound. However, the pulse width is determined by the duration of one clock (unit music note), and in the case of missing tempo data, the time interval between the upper clock at which the unit music note exists and the under clock at which no music note exists is set to the same value. Each of the track data724.726.728.730are data relating to one or more parts (musical instruments, orchestra, etc.) and responsible for playing the musical composition (background music) based on the respective conductor data (72a.72b.72c, ...). This track data724(as well as the track data726.728.730) consist of tone color group number data724a, Phrase group number data724b, Rhythm group number data724c, Rhythm selection procedure identification data724d, Playing period data724e, Play lock period data724f, Volume data724g, Acoustic data724hand transposition data724i, The tone color group number data724aare data indicating the number (reference number) assigned to the program group (timbre) (Prog). However, the tone color group number data may be724aalso be data indicating a name of the tone color group instead of the number (reference number) of the tone color group. Therefore, it becomes with reference to these tone color group number data724apossible, the memory area for storing the number of the sound waveform data (Welle_a, Welle_b, Welle_c, ...), which is used for playing the track724used to specify. The phrase group number data724bare data indicating the numbers (reference numbers) added to the phrase group (hints). However, the phrase group number data can724balso be data indicating a phrase group name instead of the phrase number (reference number) of the phrase group. Therefore, it will be with reference to these phrase group number data724bpossible to use the memory area to store the number of phrase data used for playing the track724used to specify. The rhythm group number data724care data indicating the numbers added to the rhythm group (reference numbers). However, the rhythm group number data can724calso be data indicating a name of the group instead of the number (reference number) of the rhythm group. Therefore, it will be with reference to these rhythm group number data724cpossible, the memory area for storing the rhythm group (rhythm pattern), which for playing the track724used to specify. The rhythm selection procedure identification data724dare data for identifying a selection process of the rhythm data within the selected rhythm group. In this embodiment, there are two selection methods, that is, the order selection method in which the rhythm data is selected according to the order of a table and the random selection method in which the rhythm data is randomly selected. By referring to this rhythm selection method identifi  cation data724dit will be possible to play that track724used to identify the selection procedures of the rhythm data. The play period data724eFor example, data for defining (defining) the playing period of the musical composition, and more specifically, is determined by the number of selected rhythm data in the selected rhythm group (rhythm pattern). However, to be exact, the counting manner of the selection number of the rhythm data differs between the order selection method and the random selection method. In the order selection process, when all the rhythm data included in the selected rhythm pattern are counted, one period (one cycle) is counted. On the other hand, in the random selection method, a cycle is counted each time the rhythm data included in the rhythm pattern is selected. That is, the playback period data724eindicate the number of this cycle. The play lock period data724fare data for determining a playback inhibit period of the musical composition and similar to the playback period data274eto indicate the number of selected rhythm data in the selected rhythm group (rhythm pattern). However, the difference in the way of counting the cycle between the order selection method and the random selection method is the same as in the case of the playback period data724e, Therefore, the reason why the number of times the rhythm data is selected with respect to the playback inhibit period is also set to prevent a deviation in the playback timing of the sound in the case of returning from the playback disabled state to the playback state. The volume data724gare data indicating a volume (strength of a sound). The acoustic data724hare data indicating a range of sound angles (Surround). The transposition data724iare data indicating transposition (change of a key) and the data correspond to a key signature, ""b"", ""#"", etc. The game of this embodiment is a game in which, for example, the player character who is a main character conducts the PIKMIN, which is a friend figure, and clarifies various events such as the combat of an enemy character to obtain a final result. In this game, the PIKMIN is a life-form with a double character of a plant and an animal and has as an end piece of its head on an extension, which extends from the ground. When the player figure pulls out the extension, the PIKMIN becomes part of the comrade (arrangement). In addition, there are two player characters, that is a main character and a minor character. The player presses the control part22(Actuator26), and by appropriately switching between the main character and the minor character, the player effectively resolves the various events. Around to describe it briefly the player character of the main role (hereafter referred to as ""main character"") and the player character of the supporting role (hereinafter referred to as ""secondary character"") together act, and in this case the order of PIKMINs follows both the main character as well as the minor character. In addition, the player disconnects if necessary the main character and the minor character and can then operate them separately. In This case is followed by a split arrangement of the PIKMINs and the Main character as well as the minor character. Therefore it is the main character possible, to allow the PIKMINs to arrange the main character himself to follow to fight the enemy figure and on the other hand is it is possible for the secondary character to allow the PIKMINs to arrange the minor character himself and to take on a task, such as the construction of a bridge. Further In a combat scene there is the case that the PIKMIN or the PIKMINs is eaten by an enemy figure and therefore the arrangement the PIKMINs, which follow the main character and the minor character, reduced in size becomes. at such an action game with artificial Intelligence as well as a role play becomes during the course of the game the Background music plays, and this background music will match the running situation of the game changed etc. For example played a different background music, depending on whether a normal game world or a fight scene is presented. however It is also when in a normal role play at the same Scene (situation) the same background music is played, likely that the player in the repetition of the game from the background music gets bored and the interest in the game even loses. Around To address this problem, in this embodiment, the background music every time, even in the same scene, generated, aiming, too Prevent the same background music from playing as much as possible becomes. This prevents the interest in the game from diminishing. More specifically, as a result of the execution of the in3illustrated game program by the in2illustrated CPU36a flowchart worked out, as it in the8thand9is shown. As in8thshown, when the CPU36the game starts, at step S1 a main game play is executed. Although detailed descriptions are to be avoided, a game procedure is controlled at this step S1, a game screen image is displayed, the display of the player character and the enemy character are controlled, and so forth. If the player the analog joystick (or the 3D joystick) outside the actuator26of the control part22pressed, the CPU receives36in response thereto, data regarding a tilt direction and a tilt amount of the joystick from the control part interface56, and on the basis of this data, it changes the position of the player character in the game world (world coordinate system). While the game is playing, the background music will continue to play according to the running situation of the game and so on. For example, in a fight scene, the conductor data corresponding to the fight scene is selected, and the background music is generated based on the selected conductor data. Furthermore, the DSP generates52according to a command of the CPU36as well as the audio data according to the background music data. The generated background music data becomes in the audio interface62converted into an audio signal and then from the speaker34aoutput. This is how the background music is played. This process of creating and outputting (reproducing) the background music will be described later in detail (see10to16). In the subsequent step S3, it is determined whether or not an enemy figure exists in a predetermined area. If ""NO"" in this step S3, that is, if there is no enemy figure in the predetermined area, the process proceeds directly to a step S13, on the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S3, that is, in this case, an enemy figure exists in the predetermined range, it is determined in a step S5 whether the enemy character is in the combat state or not. If ""NO"" at step S5, that is, the enemy character is not in the combat state, then the trace data for expressing the existence of an enemy character (enemy-atmosphere track) by sounds (music) becomes the conductor data of the currently playing background music is added to a step S11, and the flow proceeds to a step S35 which is in9is shown. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S5, that is, the enemy character is in the combat state, then at step S7, the combat flag becomes80ais turned on and the track data (fight track) for expressing the fight scene by sounding (music) is added to the conductor data of the currently playing background music in a step S11, and the flow goes to step S35 which is in9is shown. At step S13, it is determined whether or not an event is occurring. In this embodiment, event has the meaning of a state in which a plurality of PIKMINs carry an item or the enemy figure defeated in combat has destroyed a gate and those must make a path by building a bridge and so forth. If ""YES"" at step S13, that is, if an event expires, then the track which expresses that an event expires (event track) at step S15 is added to the conductor data with respect to the currently playing background music, and the flow goes to step S35, which is in9is shown. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S13, that is, no event expires, it is determined at step S17 whether or not the number of PIGMINs composing the array is equal to or smaller than a predetermined number (for example, 30). If ""NO"" at step S17, that is, if the number of PIGMINs composing the arrangement exceeds the predetermined number, the flow goes to an in9represented step S23 via. However, if ""YES"" at step S17, that is, in this case, the number of PIGMINs constituting the arrangement is equal to or smaller than the predetermined number, it is determined at step S19 if there is one or more at this stage (fight scene) PIGMIN (s) were killed. If "" NO "" at step S19, that is, no PIGMIN was killed at this stage, the flow goes to9represented step S23 via. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S19, which is the case when one or more PIGMIN (s) has been killed (n) at this stage, at a step S21 the small-number-order flag becomes80bis turned on to see if the arrangement of the PIGMINs has been decreased or not, and the flow advances to step S35 in FIG9above. The reason if the number of PIGMINs is equal to or less than the given number and the PIGMIN (s) killed in this stage and the small order tag80bis to distinguish them from a case where the number of PIGMINs forming an array is equal to or smaller than the number given at the time of starting the game. As in9is shown, it is determined at step S23 whether the physical strength of the player character is equal to or smaller than a predetermined level. If ""YES"" at step S23, that is, the physical strength of the player character is equal to or smaller than that  given level, at a step S25 becomes a mark, namely, the body force decreasing mark80cturned on to determine that the physical strength of the player character is reduced, and the process proceeds to step S35. If on the other hand, ""NO"" at step S23, that is, there is a case at which the physical strength the player character exceeds a predetermined level is at a Step S27 determines if the geological formation of the game world has expanded or not. If ""YES"" at step S27, that is, if the geological formation of the game world has expanded the track data for expressing by means of music that the geological formation has widened (widening track), to the conductor data of the currently playing background music added in a step S29, and the flow proceeds to step S35. However, if ""NO"" at step S27, that is, the geological formation of the game world has not been expanded, it is determined at step S31 whether or not the player character is a minor character. that is, if the player character is the main character, the process directly proceeds to step S35. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S31, that is, if the player character is the minor character, in step S33, a mark becomes the swing mark80dis turned on to see whether or not a change in the counting method of the tempo of the background music is to be performed, and the flow advances to step S35. At step S35, another game is executed. Another game procedure involves the back-up operation (backup) of the game data generated in the continuation of the game, etc. According to the continuation of the game, the game data becomes a work area of the main memory40stored, and the performance data, for example, one after another to be brought up to date. Then, when the back-up operation is carried out according to a player's command or a given event, they are put into the work area of the main memory40inscribed game data via the external storage interface60(2) in the memory card30saved. at a subsequent step S37 determines whether the game finished or not. If ""NO"" at step S37, that is, the Game is not finished, then the process returns to step S1. If on the other hand, ""YES"" at step S37, that is, when the game is over, the gameplay is also ended. The10to16Fig. 10 are flowcharts showing generation and playback operations. It is noted that these background music producing and playing operations are operations on one track, and if the conductor data includes two or more track data, the same process is carried out simultaneously (in parallel) with respect to each track. As in10shown, when the CPU36the background music producing and playing operations start, it is determined at step S41 whether or not there is a background music stop call, that is, a lock instruction (lock instruction). If ""YES"" at step S41, that is, if there is a background music stop request, the currently playing background music is stopped at step S43, that is, the background music reproduction is inhibited, then initialization at step S45 performed, the production and playback operations are switched back and the process returns to the game main at step S1 in8thback. At the Initialization operation in this step S45 become the following settings made: Tips (phrase group number) = 00; Rhythm (rhythm group number) = 00; Rhythm pedometer = 00; Play Period Marker = 0 (off); Playing period counter = 00; Abspielsperperiodenzähler = 00; Phrase number = 00 and phrase duration counter = 00. If on the other hand, ""NO"" at step S41, that is, there is no background music stop call, At step S47, it is determined whether there is a new background music call there, that is, a reproduction command for a new background music. If ""NO"" at step S47, that is, there is no new background music call, then the process goes straight to a step S55 on. If, on the other hand, at step S47 returns ""YES"", the currently played background music stopped at step S49 In a step S51, the initialization is performed Playback of the new background music becomes at a step S53 started and the flow proceeds to step S55. at the initialization at step S51 become the following settings made: Tips (phrase group number) = set value; Rhythms (rhythm group number) = fixed value; Rhythm step counter = 00; Performing period flag = 1 (switched on); Playing period counter = fixed value; Play lock period counter = set Value; Phrase number = 00 and phrase duration counter = 00. Here are fixed values by  the conductor data specified values. Therefore, a through the phrase group number data (724b) value (number) is set in the tips, one by the rhythm group number data (724cvalue (number) is set at the rhythms, a through the playback period data (724e) displayed value at the playing period counter82band one by the play lock period data (724f) displayed value at the play lock period counter82cset. At step S55, it is determined whether or not the rhythm selection method is a random mode (random selection method). More specifically, on the basis of the in the lane data (724) rhythm selection process identification data (724d) determines whether the selection process is the order selection process or the random selection process. If ""YES"" in step S55, dns is called, if the selection method is the random selection method, the flow proceeds to step S129 in FIG14above. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S55, that is, if the selection process is the order selection process, it is determined at step S57 whether the count value of the rhythm step counter82ais ""00"" or not.) If ""NO"" at step S57, that is, when the count value of the rhythm step counter82ais not equal to ""00"", the flow goes to step S103 in FIG13above. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S57, that is, if the count value of the rhythm step counter82ais equal to ""00"", the rhythm is selected in the order from the selected rhythm group at a step S59, that is, a rhythm group memory area corresponding to that in the track data (FIG.724) contains rhythm group number data (724c), and this selected rhythm group storage area is selected in order from a head. For example, in this embodiment, the rhythm group storage area is in4 (C)and the rhythm groups are selected in descending order. At a subsequent step S61, as in FIG11shown, whether all rhythms of the rhythm group have been selected. That is, it is determined whether or not the last selected rhythm group is the rearmost rhythm data of the group memory area. If "" NO "" at step S61, that is, if not all the rhythms of the rhythm group have been selected, the process goes to12represented step S85. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S61, that is, if all rhythms of the rhythm group have been selected, a head rhythm of the rhythm group is selected at step S63, and the number of steps of the selected rhythm (rhythm data) is at rhythm pedometer82aset. in this connection the number of steps means the number of steps of the selected notes (rhythm) if the previously selected Musical note (in this embodiment the sixteenth note) of a predetermined (predetermined) reference, the minimum unit is (in this embodiment: 30 steps). Therefore, if the selected rhythm data is, for example is equal to the quarter note, ""120"" is set as the step number, and if so additionally the selected ones Rhythm data of the eighth note, ""60"" is set as a step number the same applies. At a subsequent step S67, it is determined whether the playback period flag80eis turned on or not. If "" NO "" at step S67, that is, if the playback period flag80eis off, the play lock period counter becomes82cis counted down a step, which is determined to be a playback inhibit period, and in a step S71, it is determined whether the count value of the playback inhibit period counter80cis equal to ""00"" or not. If ""NO"" at step S71, that is, the count value of the playback inhibit period counter82cif not equal to ""00"", then the flow goes to a step S89 in FIG12above. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S71, that is, if the count value of the playback inhibit period counter is ""YES""82cis equal to ""00"", at step S73, the playback period flag becomes80eis turned on, in a subsequent step S75, the predetermined value at the playback inhibit period counter82cis set, and the flow goes to a step S91 in FIG12above. Further, if ""YES"" at step S67, that is, the playback period flag80eis on, becomes at the play period counter82bin step S77 is counted down by a number, which is determined to be a playback period, and it is determined in a step S79 whether or not the playback period counter82bis equal to "" 00 &quot;, if "" NO "" at step S79, that is, the count value of the playing period counter82bif not equal to ""00"", then the flow directly proceeds to a step S91 which is in12is shown. However, if ""YES"" at step S79, that is, the case has occurred that the count value of the playing period counter82bis at ""00"", it is determined in a step S81 whether the set value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis equal to ""00"". If ""NO"" at step S81, the  is the specified value of the playback inhibit period counter82cif not equal to ""00"", the process proceeds to a step S107 which is in13which determines that there is a playback inhibit period. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at the step S81, that is, it is the case that the set value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis equal to ""00"", then at step S83, the set value on the playback period counter becomes82bis set, which determines that it is not a play lock period, and the flow advances to step S91 which is in12is shown. As described above, at step S61 in FIG11it is determined that all rhythms of the rhythm group are not selected, as in12at step S85, the number of steps of the selected rhythm in the rhythm step counter82aset. At a subsequent step S87, it is determined whether the playback period flag80eis turned on or not. If ""YES"" at step S87, that is, if the playback period flag80eis switched on, the sequence proceeds to S91. However, if &quot; NO &quot; at step S87, that is, if the playback period flag80eis turned off, it is determined in a step S89 whether the combat mark80ais turned on or not. If "" NO &quot; at step S89, that is, if the combat flag80ais turned off, the process proceeds to a step S105 which is in13is shown. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S89, that is, if the combat flag80ais turned on, the flow proceeds to step S91. Thus, the flow advances to step S91 even if the play period flag80eturned off and the combat marker80is turned on so that during the fight scene the playing of the background music is enhanced and the play blocking period mark is strengthened80fis ignored. At step S91, the phrase is randomly selected (appropriately) from the set phrase group. That is, a phrase group is set according to the one in the track data (724) contained phrase group number (724b) is selected, and the phrase number stored in the memory area of the selected phrase group is randomly selected by, for example, a random number. Further, the specified phrase data randomly selected by the phrase number becomes the phrase data memory area770read out (selected). At a subsequent step S93, it is determined whether the selected phrase number and the phrase number memory area84stored phrase number match. That is, it is determined whether the phrase data selected last time and the phrase data selected this time are the same. If ""YES"" at step S93, that is, if the selected phrase number and the stored phrase number match, the phrase duration counter becomes82dis incremented by one step at step S95, and it is determined at step S97 whether the count value of the phrase duration counter82dis equal to or greater than (as) ""03."" That is, it is determined whether or not the same phrase data has been consistently selected three times or more82dis smaller than ""03"", the process directly proceeds to a step S117 which is in13is shown. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S97, that is, if the count value of the phrase duration counter82dis equal to or greater than (as) ""03"", then the flow returns to step S91, and determines that the same phrase data has been consistently selected three times, that is, if the same phrase data has been consistently selected three times, the phrase data will be out of Selection is pulled back and prevents the same phrase data from being played back three times or more, preventing the background music from becoming monotone. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S93, that is, the selected phrase number and the stored phrase number do not match, the selected phrase number becomes the phrase number storage area84of the main memory40stored (overwritten), and the count of the phrase duration counter82dis set to ""00"" (reset) in a step S101, and the flow goes to a13illustrated step S117 over. As described above, if in step S57 in FIG10it is determined that the count of the rhythm step counter82a""00"" is at an in13Step S103 determines whether the playback period flag80eis turned on or not. If ""YES"" at step S103, that is, if the playback period flag80eis turned on, the process directly proceeds to step S113, associated with the determination that there is a playing period. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S103, that is, if the playback period flag80eis turned off, the process goes to a step S105, associated with the determination that there is a playback inhibit period. In addition, as described above, if in step S81 in FIG11it is determined that the fixed value of the play lock period counter82cnot ""00"" is when in13illustrated step  S107 found that the play period marker80eis off, in step S109, the set value in the playing period counter82bis set, and the flow proceeds to step S105. At the Step S105 determines whether the phrase is playing or Not. If ""NO"" at step S105, that is, no phrase is reproduced, such that the reproduction of the phrase is inhibited in a step S111 is the flow proceeds to a step S127. If, on the other hand, at Step S105 results in ""YES"", that is, when the phrase is reproduced, it becomes the corresponding one in a step S113 the selected one Rhythm data selected Phrase reproduces, and the process proceeds to a step S115. 17Fig. 4 is a block diagram for describing a method of generating background music (musical notes) for carrying out the case in which the order selection method has been selected as a rhythm selection method. As in17 (A)For example, when the rhythm group 1 (Rhythms01) is selected, in the order selection process, the rhythm data is repetitively repeated in the order rhythm data A (Rhythm_a) in FIG780a, Rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780band rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780bselected. Further, for example, when the phrase group 1 (Tips01) is selected as described above, the phrase number included in this phrase group 1 is selected at random. Then, the phrase data determined by the selected phrase number is selected. Here is how in17 (B)represented, for example, provided that the phrase data in the order phrase data B (Tip_b) in770b, Phrase data C (Tip_c) in770c, Phrase data A (Tip_a) in770a, Phrase data A (Tip_a) in770a, Phrase data D (Tip_d) in770dand phrase data B (Tip_b) in770bto be selected. All of the in17 (A)rhythm data (music sound) correspond to those in17 (B)displayed phrase data (phrase). Further, as described above, the rhythm data defines the playing time and the timing for playing the phrase data so that each of the phrases has a part that has been extracted according to the rhythm and the music notes as in17 (C)represented, are generated. That is, the phrase data B in770b, which correspond to the (first) initial rhythm A, are extracted over a duration equal to a quarter note, which corresponds to the rhythm data A in780aequivalent. That is, the first sixteenth note, the second sixteenth note, and the third sixteenth note, which correspond to the phrase data B in FIG770bmatch are pulled out. It is noted that in17 (B)For a better understanding of the extracted phrase, part of the phrase is surrounded by a rectangular frame. Furthermore corresponds in17 (C)the duration of the note of the musical note the rhythm data, and the duration of the extracted phrase is relatively represented using a bar graph. After that they are real. For the phrase data C in770cwhich the second rhythm data B in780bmatch, the first eighth note is pulled out. For the phrase data A in770awhich the third rhythm data B in780bcorrespond, the phrase is composed of a musical note (half note), so that the sound designated by the half note is extracted in accordance with the duration equal to the eighth note, so that it the rhythm data B in780bequivalent. For the phrase data A in770awhich corresponds to the fourth rhythm data A in780aSimilarly, the tone designated by the half note is extracted according to the duration equal to the quarter note so that it corresponds to the rhythm data A in780aequivalent. For the phrase data D in770d,which the fifth rhythm data B in780bcorresponding to the duration, the tone designated by the quarter note is extracted equal to the eighth note so that it corresponds to the rhythm data B in780bequivalent. In addition, in the phrase data B in770bwhich the sixth rhythm data B in780bdo not extract the first sixteenth note and the second sixteenth note. This will cause the music notes, as in17 (C)represented, produced. The data corresponding to these notes is the background music data. However, as described above, this generation and reproduction process of the background music only affects one track, and if the conductor data includes two or more track data, the background music data generated from each track may be collectively referred to as the background music data. The CPU36plays this background music data according to the in the conductor data (720) contained tempo data (722) and determines the tone color data (tone waveform data) indicated by the in the trace data (724) contained tone color group number data724aindicated by the sound volume data (724g) and one through the acoustic data (724h) specified volume. That is, the background music data according to the tempo data722be the DSP52and the tone color data, sound volume data and acoustic data to be used are supplied (allocated)  sen). The DSP52generates the audio data for the relevant background music. This audio data is transmitted via the audio interface62from the speaker34aoutput. That is, the background music is played (reproduced). It is noted that in one example, as in17is shown, a state is reproduced in which each of the rhythm data and the phrase data is selected six times, and each time the rhythm data and the phrase data are selected once, the phrase is reproduced according to the selected rhythm. If the phrase is reproduced equal to the duration determined by the rhythm, the subsequent rhythm data and phrase data are selected. As a result, the process is repeated to reproduce the background music. Furthermore is18an outline diagram for describing a playback method in which the playback period and the playback lock period are defined (set). That in this18The illustrated example describes the case where the rhythm group 1 (Rhythms01) is selected, the rhythm group 2 is selected, and further the set value ""02"" in a playback period counter82b(One-cycle) and the specified value ""03"" in a playback inhibit period counter82c(Off cycle) is set. As in18 (A)As illustrated above, if the order selection method has been selected as the rhythm selection method, the rhythm data in the order is selected and the phrase data is selected at random. It is noted that in18for simplicity, the phrase is represented by a rectangular frame and a pattern in the frame (dashed line or left white). Further, the length (width) of the rectangular frame corresponds to the extracted phrase, and the rectangular frame of dashed lines indicates that the playback is disabled. As described above, if the order selection method has been selected, a period (one cycle) is counted when all the rhythm data constituting the rhythm pattern have been selected. As a result, when the set value ""02"" is in the playing period counter82bis set, this playing period counter counts82bbackwards when all of the following rhythm data is selected: rhythm data A in780a, Rhythm data B in780band rhythm data B in780bwhich form the selected rhythm pattern. That is, the playing period counter82bis then switched back one step each time the rhythm pattern is selected, and if the count of that play period counter82bWhen playback is disabled, the assigned value ""03"" becomes the play back period counter82cand this play lock period counter82ccounts backwards every time all the rhythm data A in780a, Rhythm data B in780band rhythm data B in780bwhich form the selected rhythm pattern also occur. That is, the play lock period counter82cwill be incremented one level each time the rhythm pattern is selected and, if the count of this play lock period counter82cPlayback is started (resumed), that is, the state returns (moves) from the play suspend state to the play state. The is called, as a result of the number of counted chosen Rhythm patterns become the play period and the play lock period measured (counted), such that, even if the state is from the play lock state to the Play state is changed, no deviation occurs in the timely emphasis of the phrase. It is noted that in this embodiment, for example, by Masking the phrase data in the play lock period caused can be that no sound is output. to13returning, as described above, in step S97 in FIG12if it is determined that the count of the phrase duration counter82dless than ""03"", the phrase duration counter82is set to ""00"" in step S101 in the same figure, and so on. If, at a step S117 as shown in FIG13is shown, then it is determined that the arrangement in the small number mark80bis turned off, the process proceeds to step S113. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S117, that is, if the arrangement is in the small-number mark80bis turned on, then a part of the selected phrase is appropriately thinned out at a step S119, and the flow advances to the step S113. That is, by playing the phrase, part of the sound is deleted. It is then superimposed by the sound, so that the PIKMIN is missing in the arrangement. For example, when part of the phrase is masked, it is possible for part of the phrase to be thinned out. At step S115, it is determined whether the swing mark80dis turned on or not. If ""YES"" at step S115, that is, if the swing mark80dis turned on, at a step S121, the counting process is changed to a hopping rhythm (swinging), and the process proceeds to a step S123. As described above, in this embodiment, the standard speed is set in advance by the number of times in one  Minute played standard music notes and a time period interval between the upper clock and the clock is set to the same interval. However, at step S121, a change is made such that the time period interval between the upper clock and the lower clock is converted to a ratio of 3: 1. This will play the background music in a rhythm as if it were bouncing. Become more special, as in19 (A)shown, at standard tempo (normal), the generated music notes, that is, the background music, played in equal time period intervals (at a ratio of 1: 1) between the upper clock (clock on) and the clock (off tact). If, on the other hand, as in19 (B)In the case of sweeping music, the counting method of the tempo is changed in such a way that the time period intervals between a period of the clock on and a period of the clock off are converted to a ratio of 3: 1, that is, the pulse width of the DSP52If the generated impulse data is changed, the background music will be played according to the changed tempo. It continues, as it turns out19 (A)and19 (B)is understood, if the counting method of the tempo is changed, also a part of the music tone changed (to express it exactly: the duration of the sound). This is due to the fact that the ratio of the time period intervals between the period clock on and the period clock off is changed. Consequently can the player by change of the counting process the tempo in a simple way not only on the screen but also over determine the played background music, whether the currently operated figure the main character or the secondary character is. The same applies below. to13returning, it is determined at step S123 whether the body force lowering flag80cis turned on. When "" NO &quot; at step S123, that is, when the body force decreasing flag80cis turned off, the process directly proceeds to a step S127. However, if &quot; YES &quot; at step S123, that is, the body force decreasing flag80cis on, the tempo is decreased in a step S125, and the flow advances to the step S127. At step S125, the tempo is changed in such a manner that the number of musical tones played in one minute is converted to, for example, half the standard tempo. However, the period between the upper clock and the lower clock is the same. That is, by extending the standard tempo data equal to one time period in the axial direction, the playback speed is kept low. After that, the same applies. At step S127, the rhythm step counter becomes82acounted back one step and the process goes to10illustrated step S41. That is, until the count of the rhythm step counter82ais converted to ""00"", the selected phrase will be played according to the selected rhythm, and if the count of the rhythm step counter82ais counted to ""00"", the following rhythm is selected and the following phrase is selected at random. As described above, in step S55 in FIG10if it has been determined that the rhythm selection method is the random selection method in a step S1129 as in14shown, determines whether the count of the rhythm step counter82ais ""00"" or not.) If ""NO"" at step S129, that is, the count value of the rhythm step counter82ais not equal to ""00"", then the process goes into16Step S171 shown above. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S129, that is, if the count value of the rhythm step counter82ais equal to ""00"", then at a step S131, the rhythm (the rhythm data) is randomly selected from the storage area of the selected rhythm data, and the number of steps of the selected rhythm at step S133 in the rhythm step counter82aset. At a subsequent step S135, it is determined whether the playing period data mark80eis turned on or not. If ""NO"" at step S135, that is, if the playback period flag80eis off, the play lock period counter becomes82cis counted down by one step at a step S137, and it is determined at a step S139 whether or not the count value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis ""00"" or not.) If ""NO"" at step S139, that is, the count value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis not equal to ""00"", then the process goes to a15Step S153. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S139, that is, if the toggle value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis equal to ""00"", then, at step S141, the play period flag becomes80eand after, at step S143, the set value in the playback inhibit period counter82chas been set, the process goes to a15Step S155. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S135, that is, if the playback period flag80cis turned on, the playing period counter becomes82bis counted up by one step at a step S1145, and it is determined at a step S147 whether the count value of the playing period counter82bis equal to ""00"" or not. If "" NO "" at step S147, that is, the count value of the playing period counter82bis not equal to ""00"", goes directly to in15Step S155. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S147, that is, if the count value of the playing period counter is82bis equal to ""00"", it is determined whether the designated count value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis ""00"" or not.) If ""NO"" at step S149, that is, the set value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis not equal to ""00"", then the process goes to a16Step S1175 associated with the determination that there is a playback inhibit period. On the other hand, if it is ""YES"" at step S17, that is, if the fixed value of the playback inhibit period counter82cis equal to ""00"", after the set value at a step S151 in the playback period counter82bhas been set, it has been determined that there is no playback inhibit period, and the procedure is in15Step S155. As described above, if in step S139 in FIG14it has been determined that the count of the play lock period counter82not equal to ""00"", at an in15Step S1153 detected, whether the combat mark80ais turned on or not. If ""NO"" at step S153, that is, the fight mark80ais not turned on, then the process goes to a16illustrated step S173 over. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S153, that is, if the combat flag80ais turned on, then at step S155, the phrase number is randomly selected from the set (selected) phrase group, and the phrase data indicated by the selected phrase number becomes the phrase data memory area770read out (selected). At a subsequent step S157, it is determined whether the selected phrase number and the phrase number memory area84stored phrase number match. That is, it is determined whether the phrase data is continuously selected or not. If ""YES"" at step S157, that is, if the selected phrase number and the stored phrase number match, the phrase duration counter becomes82din step S159, by one step, thereby determining that the phrase data is continuously selected. Then, it is determined at step S161 whether the count value of the phrase duration counter82dis equal to or greater than ""03"". If ""YES"" at step S161, that is, if the count value of the phrase duration counter82dis greater than or equal to ""03"", the flow returns to step S155 to reselect the phrase and determine that the same phrase has been selected three times, and when ""NO"" at step S161, that is, when Count value of the phrase duration counter82dis smaller than ""03"", then the flow directly proceeds to a step S167, thereby determining whether the number of times the same phrase has been selected is equal to or less than two. Further, if "" NO "" at step S157, that is, the selected phrase number and the stored phrase number do not match, the selected phrase number becomes the phrase number storage area at step S16384of the main memory40is stored (overwritten), whereby it is determined that the same phrase was not continuously selected, at step S165 the count value of the phrase duration counter becomes82dis set to ""00"" (reset), and the flow advances to step S167. At step S167, it is determined whether the small-number-order flag80bis turned on or not. If ""YES"" at step S167, that is, if the small-number-order flag80bis turned on, a part of the selected phrase is appropriately thinned out in a step S169, and the flow goes to a16Step S181 shown above. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S167, that is, the small-number-order flag80bis not switched on, then the procedure goes directly to a16Step S181 shown above. As described above, if in step S1129 in FIG14it is determined that the count of the rhythm step counter82anot equal to ""00"", while in16Step S171 determines whether the playback period flag80eis turned on or not. If ""YES"" at step S171, that is, if the playback period flag80eis turned on, the flow proceeds directly to a step S181. On the other hand, if ""NO"" at step S171, that is, if the playback period flag80eis turned off, the process proceeds to a step S173. Further, as described above, if in step S1149 in FIG14it is determined that the fixed value of the play lock period counter82cnot equal to ""00"", at an in16Step S175 shows the play period mark80eswitched off, the specified value is in the playback period counter82band the process then proceeds to a step S173. At step S173, it is determined whether the phrase is reproduced or not. If ""NO"" at step S173, that is, the phrase is not reproduced at step S179, then goes  the process proceeds directly to a step S191. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S173, that is, if the phrase is reproduced, the phrase is reproduced at step S181 corresponding to the selected rhythm, and the flow then goes to step183above. 20Fig. 10 is a block diagram for describing a method of generating background music (music script) which is played on the condition that the random selection method has been selected as a method of selecting the rhythm. As in20 (A)is shown, it is provided that, for example, the rhythm group 2 (Rhythms02) is selected and the rhythm data A (Rhythm_a) in780a, the rhythm data A (Rhythm_a) in780a, the rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780b, the rhythm data D (Rhythm_d) in780d, the rhythm data B (Rhythm_b) in780band the rhythm data C (Rhythm_c) in780cbe selected at random. Further, the phrase group 1 (Tips01) is selected, and as described above, the phrase number included in this phrase group 1 is randomly selected, and the phrase data corresponding to the phrase number becomes, for example, the phrase memory area770selected. As in20 (B)described, it is provided that the phrases in the order phrase data B (Tip_b) in770b, Phrase data C (Tip_c) in770c, Phrase data A (Tip_a) in770a, Phrase data B (Tip_b) in770b, Phrase data D (Tip_d) in770dand phrase data D (Tip_d) in770dto be selected. Alone20 (A)Rhythm data (music tones) correspond to those in20 (B)The phrase data (phrases) illustrated and described above, wherein the rhythm data define the duration of the play as well as the game timing for playing the phrase data. Therefore, in the same way as in the case of17illustrated sequence playback method, the notes, as in20 (C)represented, produced. More specifically, the phrase data B in770brepresenting the initial (first) rhythm data A in780aextracted in the duration of a quarter note, which the rhythm data A in780aequivalent. That is, the initial sixteenth note, the second sixteenth note and the third sixteenth note, which corresponds to the phrase data B in FIG770bmatch are pulled out. Similarly, the phrase data C in770cwhich the second rhythm data A in780ain the form of the first eighth note, the second quarter note and the third eighth note. For the phrase data A in770awhich the third rhythm data B in780bThe phrase is constructed from a half note, so that the note marked by this half note is extracted for the duration of one eighth note, which corresponds to the rhythm data B in780bequivalent. For the phrase data B in770bwhich corresponds to the fourth rhythm data D in780dthe first sixteenth note, the second sixteenth note, the third eighth note and the fourth eighth note are extracted. For the phrase data D in770dwhich the fifth rhythm data B in780bthe tone designated by the first quarter note is extracted over the duration of an eighth note, which corresponds to the rhythm data B in780bequivalent. Further, in the phrase data D in770dwhich correspond to the sixth rhythm data C in780cextracted, the first quarter note, the second quarter note and the third dotted quarter note and the fourth eighth note. It is noted that in the in20illustrated example according to the in17For example, a state is shown in which each of the rhythm data and each phrase data is selected six times, the phrases are reproduced according to the selected rhythm, and when the phrase is reproduced equal to the rhythm-determined duration, the subsequent rhythm data and phrase data are selected. So the process is repeated and thus the background music reproduced. Furthermore, as in18 (B)if the random selection method is selected, as described above, all the rhythm data and all the phrase data are randomly selected. Further, as described above, if the random selection method is selected, one period (one cycle) is counted each time, so that the rhythm data is selected to construct a rhythm pattern. Therefore, if the set value ""02"" in the playing period counter82bis set, this playing period counter counts82beach time one level back when rhythm data is selected and when the count of the playing period counter82bWhen playback is disabled, the set value ""03"" becomes the play-back period counter82cand this play lock period counter82ccounts down one level each time rhythm data is selected. If the count of the play lock period counter82cbecomes ""00"", the state is changed from the play lock state to the play state (returned). It It is noted that the reason why in the play lock period the phrase data is masked, the same as in the case of Order-selection process. Consequently In the random selection method, the play periods also become and the play lock periods measured (counted) depending on how many times rhythm data selected were, so even in the case that the state of the play lock state is transferred to the playback state, no deviation occurs in the timing of the emphasis of the phrase. It it is noted that in this case the reproduction of the background music the same as in the case of the above-described order selection process. To16returning, it is determined at step S183 whether the swing mark80dis turned on or not. If "" YES "" at step S183, that is, if the swing mark80dis turned on, the counting method of the tempo is changed to a hopping rhythm at a step S185, and the flow advances to a step S1187. On the other hand, if &quot; NO &quot; at step S183, which is the case when the momentum flag80dis turned off, the process directly proceeds to step S187. In step S187, it is determined whether the body force reduction flag80cis turned on or not. If "" NO "" at step S187, that is, the body force decreasing flag80cis turned off, the flow proceeds directly to a step S191. On the other hand, if ""YES"" at step S187, that is, if the body force decreasing flag80cis turned on, the tempo is decreased at step S189, and then the flow proceeds to step S191. At step S191, the rhythm step counter becomes82aone step back and the process returns to10back to step S41. That is, until the count of the rhythm step counter82abecomes ""00"", the selected phrase is reproduced after the selected rhythm, and when the count of the rhythm step counter82becomes ""00"", the subsequent rhythm and phrase are randomly selected. It should be noted that although the background music is avoided in the generation and playback operations, the background music data to be generated corresponds to the transpose data724ican be transposed. A marker (transpose marker) is turned on and off according to a previous operation by the player, a previous game situation or a predetermined event, and, if the transpose marker is turned on, in the marker memory area80stored and then it is possible to transpose, for example, the generated background music data. This also makes it possible to play the background music half a tone higher or lower, and so on. at this embodiment become the background music data according to the conductor data fortuitously chosen Phrase data generated depending on the game situation. The rhythm data is selected according to a predetermined rule, so that possibility Little is likely that the same background music again is played. This means The fascination of the game can be increased and it becomes possible prevent the interest in the game itself because of the fact lost is that the same background music is played. Farther The background music data is rendered using phrase data and rhythm data prepared in advance, so it is not necessary is, the phrase data and the rhythm data (rhythm patterns) too produce. Therefore, process loading of background music becomes not extended. It It must be noted that in this embodiment, if the arrangement the PIKMINs is scaled down, part of a part (lane) chosen Phrase is thinned out and reproduced in a suitable manner. However, there can be the reproduction of any or a variety of track (s) are blocked. Even though in this embodiment the phrase data and the rhythm data are divided into groups and in big Number stored, it is still possible to use different background music to produce on the condition that in each case for each the records at least one group is provided. Furthermore is in this embodiment a change the background music to be reproduced according to the operation by the player, according to the previous game situation (event) etc. triggered. However, these are just examples and points that a developer, such as a game programmer or the like. This means, it is necessary to consider the point of view that the change the reproduced background music at any event etc. is initiated. Furthermore, in this embodiment, only the video game machine described in US Pat1is shown. However, it is essential to say that the present invention is also applicable to a game  advises with integrated monitor and speaker, to a game handset, to mobile phone with game function, etc. can be adjusted. Even though the present invention is described and illustrated in detail It is self-evident that this is for purposes of illustration and only by way of example. This description is not intended to be limiting the scope of the present invention, the alone from the attached claims results."

Inflammation plays a role both in the development of atherosclerosis and in the acute activation of the vascular wall, followed by local thrombosis and vasoconstriction. Many patients with unstable angina and AMI have systemic signs of inflammation. The use of systemic inflammatory markers, such as the use of C-reactive protein as a marker for disease activity and short- and long-term prognosis, appears to have clinical value. Therefore, an acute inflammatory reaction that is detectable systemically is a potential risk factor for CHD and AMI. Since CHD is a polygenic disease, it is reasonable to assume that mechanisms involved in the regulation of genetic variation in biochemical pathways that play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and CHD are found to be associated with the pathogenesis and therapy of CHD. 15 One of the markers of inflammation currently studied is defensin. Defensins are a family of small, cationic, antibiotic peptides containing six cysteines in a disulfide bond. Peptides are plenty of phagocytes humans and other mammals and ί of the small intestine mucosa. They contribute to the host's defense against microbes and can participate in tissue inflammation and endocrine regulation during infection (Ganz and Lehrer 1995, Valore et al. 1998) and are part of the innate immune system (Jia et al. 2001). There are two classes of defensin genes, A and β, which differ in * * * · ""disulfide bond mating, genomic organization, and tissue distribution. • · 1. * • * «: In addition to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties, there is evidence that β-defensins · · act as chemokines for immature dendritic cells and memory T cells and may serve as an important bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems (Jia et al. • · * · ;;; 2001, Hoover et al. 2001). · • · '4 «·. Defensins are usually isolated from cytoplasmic granules with their primary target • · · ·! Being in the phagolysosomes, although a small amount of peptide is released into the bloodstream * * 30 during infection or inflammation. also found in media near the outer elastic layer and in some periadventional vessels. * · ·. * ·; This indicates the presence of defensin in the walls of the human coronary arteries. Intravascular deposition of defensins 3,118,265 may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of inflammation in addition to their host defense role (Bamathan et al. 1997). Antimicrobial activity of β-defensin peptides is inherently sensitive to salt and their killing is significantly reduced as the ionic strength of the solutions increases (i.e., NaCl> 50 mM) (Schutte and McCray 2002). The primary structure of each β-defensin gene product is characterized by its small size, the motif of the six cysteines, its high cationic charge and extremely high variability in addition to these features. The most characteristic feature of defensin proteins is the motif of their six cysteines. Each β-dcfensin gene encodes a preproprotein having a size between 59 and 80 amino acids with an average size of 65 amino acids. This gene product is then cleaved to create a mature peptide between 36 and 47 amino acids in size with an average size of 45 amino acids (Schutte and McCray 2002) and a molecular weight of 3 to 4 kD (Bensch et al. 1995). At least six beta-adefensins have been characterized in humans (HBD-1, HBD-2, HBD-3, HBD-,1 4,1IBD-5, HBD.6). Human β-defensin-1 (HB D-1) was the first characterized 1-isolated β-defensin from the blood flow of dialysis patients with end-stage 20 renal disease (Lehmann et al. 2002). The HBD-1 gene is expressed. predominantly in urogenital epithelial organs such as kidney, bladder, * · ·% ureter and female genitalia and is less expressed in pancreas, - * * * ""··. liver and other epithelium. In situ hybridization of kidney shows that HBD-1 * * • * ·. ···.

Identifying useful markers of inflammation and host resistance (such as defensins), identifying novel therapeutic targets for interfering with these mechanisms, and evaluating the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapies will allow progress in our ability to prevent, treat, and combat complications of CHD. 1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a method of screening an subject for assessing whether an individual is at risk for developing myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease based on the genotype of the defensin gene.

In these? In the methods, a nucleic acid-containing sample (e.g., blood, tissue sample, or buccal cells) is obtained from the patient and the sequence variations of interest are identified and evaluated. Allelic variants in genes can be distinguished by enzymatic methods 10 (by restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerases, ligases, etc.), electrophoretic methods 4 [e.g. single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis, fragment analysis, and DNA sequencing], solid phase assays (dot abrasives, microarrays, microparticles, microtiter plates, etc.) and physical methods [e.g. hybridization analysis, mass spectrometry, and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)]. Most genotyping assays use various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applications to both increase the signal ratio to the background and save the sample nucleic acid prior to allele separation. Detectable labels (fluorochromes, radioactive labels, biotin, modified nucleotides, hapten, etc.) can be used to enhance visualization of allelic variants.

The method can be used in the prediction and early diagnosis of AMI in adult adults, in the partitioning and selection of subjects for clinical trials, in the selection and selection of individuals for enhanced preventive and curative interventions. The aim is to reduce the cost of clinical trials and healthcare. The assay can be used to test the risk of developing AMI in both 5 1) healthy subjects as a screening and susceptibility test and 2) high risk subjects (e.g., family history of CHD or elevated serum cholesterol or hypertension or diabetes or any combination thereof). Because inflammation is caused by AMI and other forms of CHD, anti-inflammatory agents may potentially be used in the prevention and treatment of AMI and chronic CHD. Individuals with impaired host resistance to inflammation, for example due to reduced expression or production of human defensin protocols, will therefore benefit from defensin enhancing medications, diets, and other therapies. More generally, 1 all people could benefit from the enhancement of the defensin system through a reduction in their AMI and CHD-15 risk and subsequent increase in longevity. In particular, individuals who have reduced levels of defensin or have mutations in the genes encoding human defensins benefit from such treatment. Other groups or individuals who gain increased benefit from defensin-enhancing therapies include § persons who already have CHD.

The polymerase lengthens the primer by only one nucleotide, adding one [F] ddNTP to its 3 'end. Because each of the four [F] ddNTPs is labeled with a different fluorescent dye, genotypes can be distinguished. 5 If multiple SNPs are to be determined in the same reaction, the extension primers need to be designed such that they differ significantly in length (4-6 nucleotides). The length of the primer can be modified by adding a variable but known number of non-homologous nucleotides (dT, dA, dC or cGATC) to the 5 'end of the extension primers. Due to the difference in length of the extension primers, snapshot products can be detected by capillary electrophoresis according to the size of the product.

Thus, depending on the allele 10, the ADRA2B locus has either 9 Glu (deletion, variant) (SEQ ID NO: 2). NO: 20) or 12 Glurta (insertion) (SEQ ID NO: 22). Depending on whether the amplified allele had insertion or deletion at the locus examined, the size of the PCR product was 91 bp (insertion allele) or 82 bp (deletion allele). For homozygotes (insertion / insertion or? Deletion / deletion), only a single size fragment was detected, either 91 bp (insertion / insertion) 15 or 82 bp (deletion / deletion).

AMI and CHD risk testing Risk factors for MI and coronary heart disease were studied in the KIHD cohort.

Results from CHD and AMI during follow-up were obtained via computer connection from a national * · 1 30 computer hospital to the Home Access Registry. Diagnostic information was collected from * 1 ht · hospitals and all heart attack events were classified according to strict, pre-defined criteria. Diagnostic classification of acute coronary events was based on symptoms, electrocardiographic findings, elevations of cardiac enzymes, autopsy findings, and history of CHD. Each suspected 21 1 1 8265 coronary events (ICD-9 codes 410-414 and ICD-10 codes 120-125) were classified as 1) severe acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 2) probable AMI, 3) typical, more than 20 minutes acute chest pain episode , which showed CHD, 4) ischemic cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, 5) no acute coronary event, or 6) no classifiable fatal case. Categories 1) to 3) were combined for the present analysis to denote MI. Of the 1,548 male subjects used in the analysis, of which complete data were available, 256 men developed during AMI follow-up. Hypertension was defined as either systolic blood pressure (BP)> 165 mmHg or diastolic 10 BP> 95 mmHg or as antihypertensive therapy. The nurse measured both blood pressure in the morning with a random-zero mercury blood pressure monitor. The measurement procedure included three measurements on his back, one in a standing position and two in a sitting position every five minutes. Averages for all six measurements were used as systolic and diastolic blood pressures. CHD family history was defined as positive if either the subject's mother, 15 fathers, or siblings had a history of AMI or angina pectoris. Family histories of cerebrovascular stroke and diabetes were similarly defined. The Socio-economic Status of Adults (SES) is an index of education, work, income and material living standards. The scale is reversed with a low score corresponding to a high SES. This information has been collected through a self-administered questionnaire.

Genotyping of paraoxonase 1 and HFE (HLA-H) mutations is. described elsewhere (Salonen et al. 1999, Tuomainen et al. 1999). Of the 1,548 men genotyped in the beta-adefensin-1 gene, 3'UTR + 5, 165 were AA- • · homozygotes, 690 heterozygotes, and 693 GG homozygotes. • · 19.0% (132 men) of GG homozygotes developed their first AMh after 14.5% • · *.

The association between GG genotype and AMI risk tended to be more pronounced in men with no previous history of CHD (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.04-2.00, p = 0.030). with a history of CHD (hazard ratio 1.32, 95 5% CI 0.81-2.17, p = 0.314). Other gene mutations that predicted AMI in the logistic model were deletion / insertion in the alpha-2B adrenergic receptor gene and Thr98Ile-SNP in the apolipoprotein B gene (Table 1). The phenotypic data contributing to AMI prediction were age, history of any 10 atherosclerotic disease, smoking cigarette years, family history of CHD and diabetes, presence of type 2 diabetes, and total serum cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) -olol. An empirical, binary, logistic function was constructed from these 12 variables (Table 1). Population-based risk, calculated using the Quintiles of Risk Score according to Miettinen OS, was 0.76. 15 Quintile hazard ratio (Lowest comparison): 12.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.2 - 22.9, 6.4 (3.5 - 11.5), 2.4 (1.3 - 4.6) and 1.5 (0.8 - 3.1).

The same three mutations predicted AMI. Of the questionnaire measurements, the strongest predictors were CHD's history at the site and his socio-economic status. The most predictive of biochemical measurements were serum ferritin '5 concentration (classified into two classes), serum C-reactive protein, serum LDL cholesterol, and serum HDL cholesterol (protective). Using the default predicted probability distribution (0.50), the model correctly predicted 94.0% of the observed AML. Using a 0.2 probability distribution, the hazard ratio was 8.2, with a 95% CI of 4.0-18.8, p <0.001. 10 In the second statistical analysis, we analyzed AMI predictors within two years of risk factor measurements (Table 4). The Leu54Met mutation in the paraoxonase 1 gene and the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE (HLA-H) gene were the strongest genetic predictors of AMI. Other non-genetic predictors are shown in Table 4. 15 Thus, we present herein a new genetic test based on genotyping mutations in the human defensin gene, such as the human beta-defensin-1 and -129 genes, with an optional multivariate model that correctly predicts future myocardial infarction in the data set from which they were derived.

The risk model can be evaluated / monitored for different lengths, · · · which allows their use for different purposes. • · * ····· '. • · ··· '. • · 1 * · · · • 1 · • ·· • · 118265;> ^ MOiriTt ^ rScSOO ^ -i ^^ rO Ρ οο \ ο o tq -h tq ο ^ »η {sq-t ^ ö I Ν Ή * «Μ * ρί (N ^ D - Ο ο ° Ö —Γ SO VO Γ-"" '</ ""Γ ιτΓ θ' Os fT OS so ^ ο ^ σγ σ> ο ^ ^ ·„ on ^ ^ q ο ν OS γ3> —Γ Ψ- * θ 'o' ** I — Γ t — Γ —I - I — I ι-Γ θ 'ο —---------— ------- ---- Λ Μ '3 4J γ- Ό s S rt 5 l5 *** SS ui v> \ D m oo O o M h m m P ctf CO Γ-- r ^) O On O On ^ (N P « ^ I> rS --Γ ^ rS i-H ^ -1 ^ -Γ ΓΠ -h «O C --------------------- PJ s' t oo Γ 'oo - o n o ^ n Λίίί -.' ^ - ΟΟΟΌΟΟοΟοΟοΟ O =? o OOO oo O o '° θ' Ö 'X Cu o' o 'o' o 'VV o V o V oo Ό —---------—--------- <n rs 1¾ SO O Γ3 m - 00 t> VO o «O Ό CJ \., SW - m - 'rs —i 0"" -q —r rs o rq g oo o' o ""o"" o ""o 'o"" V do ό o 'o' § B ^ B β | .ao · «+ CfcJOVO'-iOvooOsO ^ foomcNoo e u rq lt> m q o Ό θ__ sq rs r- | rs -3 o ""o"" o 'o' o 'o' o 'o ö -' o ', ζΛ ---—----—-------' 5b 0 u - Π goo - λ O ο ΰ h 1 3 £ 2 H P ^ <u «ϋ O . ·. : a o <£ 5 ^ o ·. *: «'-3 ± .2 .2"" • · «s 3 e £ Ή s:. :: s = p ^ £ 1 << <<< c <<. ···. -g S? o 5 £ H £ fc fc • * .2¾ .— -------------- '** B ··· ^ C / 3:: oo> * * · ^ d «, _4 • ^ g oi ~ cd ~, *: * ~> .2> g ~ ^. ***. w 5 ω 'q' - 'a -¾ II c «o ό 2 rt o Bo ... ω § ω W Ο · - £ eg Ν2 Μ) 3 0 / £?
