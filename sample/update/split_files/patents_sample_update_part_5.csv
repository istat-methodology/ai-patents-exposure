2010,DK-1925615-T3,A method for fluorine-18-selection of tropane derivatives ,2006,"DESCRIPTION [0001] The invention relates to a one-step [18F]radiolabelling process of tropanamine derivatives which are useful for imaging the neuronal dopamine transporter (DAT) with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). [0002] Several affections, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder or drug abuse, are related to abnormalities within the brain's dopamine system. In particular, the neuronal dopamine transporter, a membrane-bound presynaptically located protein, plays a key role in regulating the synaptic concentration of dopamine at nerve terminals and thus dopamine neurotransmission in the brain. Taking into account that DAT density can be considered as a marker of the integrity and number of presynaptic striatal dopamine-producing neurons, considerable efforts have been spent in recent years on the design and development of DAT-selective radioligands as in vivo Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging tools for the study of these illnesses and disorders as well as the evaluation of the degree of success of their treatment. [0003] Certain tropane-type derivatives including cocaine represent today the largest class of molecules ever developed for imaging the DAT with PET and therefore labelled with a positron-emitting radioisotope. [0004] From a radiochemical point of view, many of these derivatives have been labelled with the short-lived radioisotope carbon-11 (half-life: 20.38 min) at their W-methyl group or methyl ester function using [11C]methyl iodide or [11C]methyl triflate (for example, β-CIT or β-CCT). Also, a relatively large number of these derivatives have been labelled with fluorine-18 (half-life: 109.8 min), today the most widely used positron-emitting radioisotope, by aliphatic nucleophilic fluorination (for example, FE-CNT or β-FE-CCT) or aromatic electrophilic fluorination (β-CFT). Finally, a few of these derivatives have been labelled with bromine-76, a longer-lived positron-emitter (half-life: 16.1 h), by electrophilic bromination (for example, CBT) (Table 1). Table 1 [0005] Today, fluorine-18, beyond its adequate physical and nuclear characteristics, appears as the most attractive positron-emitting radioisotope for radiopharmaceutical chemistry and PET imaging, part of this continuous growing interest probably due to the successful use in clinical oncology of [18F]FDG, actually the most widely used PET-radiopharmaceutical. [0006] Briefly, fluorine-18 displays simple decay- and emission properties with a high 97% positron abundance. Compared with the other conventional short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides carbon-11, nitrogen-13 and oxygen-15, fluorine-18 has a relatively low positron energy (maximum 635 keV) and the shortest positron linear range in tissue (2.3 mm), resulting in the highest resolution in PET imaging. Its half-life (109.8 min) is long enough to give access to relatively extended imaging protocols compared to what is possible with carbon-11, therefore facilitating kinetic studies and high-quality plasma metabolite analysis. Moreover, from a chemical point of view, fluorine-18 allows for multi-step synthetic approaches that can be extended over hours. Finally, fluorine-18 can be reliably and routinely produced at the multi-Curie level, using the well-characterized (p,n) nuclear reaction on an oxygen-18-enriched water target on widely implemented biomedical cyclotrons of a relatively low-energy proton beam (e.g., 18 MeV). This distinctive advantage, combined with its favourable half-life, permits the transport and the use of fluorine-18-labelled radiopharmaceuticals (such as the archetype [18F]FDG) at 'satellite' PET units without an on-site cyclotron production facility. [0007] LBT-999 (1,8-((E)-4-fluoro-but-2-enyl)-3p-p-tolyl-8-aza-bicydo[3.2.1]octane-26-carboxylic acid methyl ester) is a cocaine derivative belonging to a new generation of highly selective dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands (Kq : 9 nM and IC50 > 1000 nM for the serotonine and norepinephrine transporters). [0008] Recently, LBT-999 has been successfully labelled with the positron-emitter carbon-11 (half-life: 20.38 min) at its methyl ester function from the corresponding carboxylic acid precursor and the methylation reagent [11C]methyl triflate (Dollé R et al., 2006), permitting preliminary in vivo pharmacological evaluation of this radiotracer by both biodistributions in rodents and brain imaging in non-human primates with positron emission tomography (PET) (Chalon S. et al., 2006). Taken together, the results so far obtained demonstrate that LBT-999 is a highly promising candidate for in vivo exploration in humans of DAT, using PET (Chalon S. et al., 2006). [0009] The chemical structure of LBT-999 permits also its labelling at its fluoromethylvinyl moiety with fluorine-18 (half-life: 109.8 min), today one of the most attractive positron-emitting radioisotopes for radiopharmaceutical chemistry. Table 2 [0010] The robust and reliable pathway frequently proposed for the labelling with fluorine-18 of such molecules is a two-step radiochemical process, involving first the preparation of an appropriate halogeno or better sulphonyloxy [18F]reagent. The radiosynthesis of n-bromo-, n-tosyloxy- and n-mesyloxy 1-[18F]fluoroalkanes (n = 1-3) from the corresponding bifunctional alkanes by nucleophilic aliphatic substitution with no-carrier-added [18F]fluoride as its activated K[18F]F-Kryptofi>^)222 complex (Coenen H.H. et al., 1986; Hamacher K., et al., 1986) has been extensively studied (Block D. et al., 1987). This methodology has been applied with success to the preparation of several [18 F]fluoroethyl- (Goodman M.M. et al., 1994; Firnau G. et al., 1995; Goodman M.M. et al., 2000; Deterding T.A. et al., 2001; Votaw J.R. et al., 2002; Wilcox K.M. et al., 2002; Davis M.R. et al., 2003; Votaw J.R. et al., 2003; Votaw J.R. et al., 2004; Lindsey K.P. et al., 2004; Harada N. et al., 2004; Stehouwer J.S. et al., 2005) and [18F]fluoropropyl- (Goodman M.M. et al., 1994; Firnau G. et al., 1995; Chaly T. et al., 1996; Goodman M.M. et al., 1997; Kazumata K. et al., 1998; Ma Y et al., 2002; Chaly T. et al., 2004) tropane derivatives (compound A-G, Table 2), like for example [18F]FECNT and P-[18F]CIT-FP. More recently, the radiosynthesis of both ( E)- and (Z)-1-[18F]fluoro-4-tosyloxybut-2-ene has also been briefly described and used for the first time for the preparation of (E)-and (Z)-[18F]FBCINT (compound H, Table 2) (Chen R et al., 1999 ; Goodman M.M. et al., 2002). [0011] It has now been discovered that a class of compounds, referred to herein as compounds of formula (II), are useful agents for preparing the [18F]radioactively labelled compounds of formula (I). More specifically, these compounds allow to obtain the radiolabelled compounds of formula (I) in only one-step radiochemical process, with high radiolabelling yields and high radiochemical purity. [0012] The one-step radiochemical process referred herein also brings the following advantages, when compared to the classical two-step process described above. It first allows to use only one precursor for labelling (compounds of formula II) instead of two precursors for labelling. Further, these precursors of formula (II) may be used in limited amounts (typically 2-5 mg) as compared to the two-step radiochemical process disclosed in the prior art which generally both requires a large excess and high amounts (typically 2 20 mg) of the nortropamine derivative. Therefore, it also reduces the level of impurities in the radiolabelled compounds of formula (I). This one-step process also makes the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) easier and faster, allowing a more robust automation. This one-step process also makes the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) safer by reducing notably the exposure to the radioactivity. [0013] Further, this one-step process allows to prepare [18F]radiolabelled compounds of formula (I) with an higher radioactivity level, which is particularly useful for PET imaging. [0014] Thus, in one aspect, the invention is directed to the compounds of formula (II): wherein: • X is Cl, Br, I, or a group OSO2R5; • Z is R-| C=CR2 or C = C ; • R-|, R2 are each independently H, C-|-Cø alkyl, Cø-C-io aryl, wherein said alkyl or aryl groups are optionally substituted by one to three (¾ groups; • R3 is H or C-|-C6 alkyl, wherein said alkyl group is optionally substituted by one to three R6 groups; • p is 1,2 or 3 ; • R4 is/are independently H, Cl, Br, I, F, or C -)-Cø alkyl, wherein said alkyl group is/are optionally substituted by one to three Rg groups; • R5 is a Ci-Cø alkyl, preferably C1-C4 alkyl, said alkyl being optionally mono-, poly- or perhalogenated, a C3-C8 cycloalkyl or a C6-C12 aryl, wherein said alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl are optionally substituted by one to three C1-C4 alkyl groups or F, Cl, Br, NO2, or CN; • Rø is OH, F, Cl, Br, phenyl or methyl, • m is 1,2, 3 or 4, and • n is 1,2, 3 or 4, and its stereoisomeric forms, mixtures of stereoisomeric forms, and salt forms thereof.

Of these, 0S02-CgH4-CH3, OSO2-CF3, OSO2-CH3, commonly designates as tolyloxy (OTs), mesyloxy (OMs) and trifyloxy (OTf) respectively, are particularly preferred. [0016] Preferably, X is Cl, Br, I, more preferably X is Cl. [0017] Preferably, Z is R-|C=CR2· [0018] Advantageously, when Z is trans R-|C=CR2 or C=C, the leaving group X does not undergo an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution by the nitrogen atom of the tropane. These compounds of formula (II) are thus relatively stable under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. [0019] Preferably, R1 and R2 are independently selected from H and C1-C4 alkyl, notably methyl or ethyl. More preferably, R1 and R2 are H. [0020] Preferably, Z is trans (E). [0021] Preferably, m is 1. [0022] Preferably, n is 1. ΓΟΟ931 In a Dreferred embodiment of the invention, the invention relates to compounds of formula (lla): (I la) wherein X, R3, R4 and p are as defined above. [0024] Preferably, R3 is C1-C4 alkyl, more preferably methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, most preferably methyl. [0025] R4 may be C-|-C6 alkyl, more preferably C1-C4 alkyl, notably a methyl group.

[0027] Preferably, the compound of formula (lla) is the N-(£-4-chloro-but-2-enyl)-3p-(4-methylphenyl)nortropane-2p-carboxylic methyl ester. [0028] In another aspect, the invention also relates to a method for preparing a [18F]radiolabelled compound of formula (I): wherein, Z, R3, R4, m, n and p are as defined above, comprising the steps of: 1. i) reacting a compound of formula (III) (III) wherein Y is Cl, Br, I or OSO2R5, X, Z, R5, m and n being as defined above, with a compound of formula (IV) wherein R3, R4 and p are as defined above, in the presence of a base in an appropriate solvent; and optionally 2. ii) recovering the obtained compound of formula (II) as defined above, 3. iii) contacting a compound of formula (II), with a source of 18F anion in an appropriate solvent; and optionally 4. iv) recovering the obtained [18F]radiolabelled compound of formula (I).

Of these, the alkali metal [18F]fluorides, and notably a potassium fluoride, are preferred. [0031] The source of 18F anions may be activated by the presence of a ligand able to complex the counter cationic species of the source of 18F anions. The ligand may be notably a cyclic or polycyclic multidentate ligand. [0032] Examples of suitable ligands include notably crown ethers such as 1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclooctadecane (18C6) or cryptands such as 4,7,13,16, 21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo-[8,8,8]hexacosane sold under the name K222®.

[0034] The complex K[18F]/K222® may be prepared by any conventional methods, for example as disclosed in F. Dollé et al., 1999; L. Dolci et al., 1999. [0035] The method for preparing the [18F]radiolabelled compound of formula (I) can take place over a wide range of temperatures, and the precise reaction temperature is not critical to the invention. In general, it is convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from about 50°C to about 150°C (more preferably, from about 80°C to about 100°C). [0036] The time required for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, provided that the reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from about 5 minutes to about 15 minutes will usually suffice. [0037] The compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by filtration on a pre-packed separation column. [0038] Additionally, the product can, if desired, be further purified by various well known techniques, such as chromatography techniques, notably High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). [0039] There is no particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here, provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of suitable bases include alkylamines, such as triethylamine. [0040] There is no particular restriction on the nature of the solvent to be employed, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved. Examples of appropriate solvents include notably polar solvents such as acetonitrile.

[0069] Introduction of the cyclotron-produced fluorine-18 as the, no-carrier-added, activated K[18F]F-Kryptofix®>222 complex (Coenen H.H. et al., 1986 ; Hamacher K. et al., 1986) was performed as follows : a DMSO solution (600 pL) containing 3.5-4.5 mg of 8-((£)-4-Chloro-but-2-enyl)-3p-p-tolyl-8-aza-bicyclo-[3.2.1]octane-2p-carboxylic acid methyl ester (9, 10.0-12.9 pmol) were transferred (See experimental part) to the dried K[18F]F-K222 complex in a reaction vial (Vacutainer® tube). The unsealed tube was thoroughly vortexed and then heated (heating block) at 165°C for 10 minutes without stirring the contents. The reaction vessel was cooled (ice-water bath) and the remaining radioactivity was measured, which was 96% to over 99% of the initial radioactivity. The radiochemical yields of fluorine-18 incorporation, calculated from the TLC-radiochromatogram and defined as the ratio of radioactivity area of [18F]-10 over total fluorine-18 radioactivity area, were about 30% to 40%. At this stage, a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge (PrepSep™ R-C18 Extraction Column, see experimental) was used to rapidly isolate [18F]-10 (with a radiochemical purity >90%, according to radio-HPLC) from the reaction, which represented 30-35% of the total radioactivity amount engaged in the fluorination process whereas most likely non reacted [18F]fluoride, 65-70% of the total radioactivity, was eluted off the cartridge (waste). These values clearly confirmed the radiochemical yields measured by radio-TLC. [0070] FIPLC purification of [18F]LBT-999 ([18F]-10) was performed on a semipreparative Symmetry® C18 column (HPLC B, see experimental), using a mixture of H2O/CH3CN/TFA (72:28:0.1 (v/v/v)) as the eluent. Using these conditions, [18F]-10 (iR : 12.5-13.5 minutes) could be obtained with a >95% chemically and radiochemically purity and was ideally separated within a short total purification time (less than 20 minutes) from the non-labelled chloro-derivative 9 (fR : 15.5-17.5 minutes), as well as from an unidentified fluorine-18-labelled impurity at fR : 14.0-15.0 minutes (up to 10% compared to [18F]-10). Atoo low chemical purity (< 90%) was observed using a previously reported FIPLC system used for the purification of [18F]-10 (HPLC C, column: semipreparative SunFire™ C18, eluant : H2O/CH3CN/TFA : 70:30:0.1 (v/v/v), fR ([18F]-10): 9.0-10.0 min (Dollé F. et al., 2006). [0071] Introduction of fluorine-18 was also performed with the K[18F]F-Kryptofix®222 complex and microwave activation (at 100 Watt for 2 minutes). Incorporation yields (calculated from the TLC-radiochromatogram or after the C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge purification) were similar to those described above, with however formation in moderately higher ratio of the unidentified fluorine-18-labelled impurity (about 40-50% compared to [18F]-10). HPLC purification using the system described above gave nevertheless >95% chemically and radiochemically pure [18F]-10 (fR : 12.5-13.5 minutes), still well separated from this side product (fR : 14.0-15.0 minutes). [0072] Formulation of [18F]LBT-999 ([18F]-10) as i.v. injectable solution was performed using a home-made Sep-pak®Plus C18 device. The HPLC-collected fraction containing the radiotracer was diluted with water and the resulting solution was passed through a C18 Sep-pak® cartridge. The cartridge was then washed with water, partially dried with nitrogen and finally eluted with ethanol followed by physiological saline. The solution was then sterile-filtered and diluted with physiological saline to an ethanol concentration below 10%. [0073] Quality controls of [18F]LBT-999 ([18F]-10) were performed on an aliquot of the preparation ready for i.v. injection. The radiotracer preparation was a clear and colourless solution with a measured pH between 5 and 7. As demonstrated by analytical HPLC analysis (HPLC D, see experimental), the radiotracer preparation was found to be > 95% chemically and radiochemically pure (1, fR : 2.25 min). The preparation was shown to be free of the non-radioactive precursor 9 (fR : 3.45 min) as well as the unidentified fluorine- 18-labelled side-product (fR : 2.58 min), and was chemically and radiochemically stable for at least 120 minutes. Conclusion [0074] The highly selective dopamine transporter ligand LBT-999 (10, 8-((E)-4-fluoro-but-2-enyl)-3p-p-tolyl-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2p-carboxylic acid methyl ester) has been labelled in one radiochemical step with fluorine-18 at its fluoromethylvinyl moiety. Typically, 70-100 mCi of [ 18F]LBT-999 ([18F]-10, 2.59-3.07 GBq, > 95% chemically and radiochemically pure) could be obtained with a specific radioactivity of 1-3 Ci/pmol (37-111 GBq/pmol) in 80-85 minutes of radiosynthesis (HPLC purification and formulation included), starting from a 1000 mCi (37.0 GBq) [18F]fluoride production batch (overall yields : 7.0% to 10.0% non decay-corrected and 11.6-17.1% decay-corrected). Experimental General Chemicals. Flash chromatography and TLC analysis. [0075] Chemicals were purchased from Aldrich-, Fluka- or Sigma France and were used without further purification. Flash chromatographies were conducted on silica gel (0.63-0.200 mm, VWR) columns. TLCs were run on pre-coated plates of silica gel 60F254 (Merck). The compounds were localized (1) when possible at 254 nm using a UV-lamp and/or (2) by dipping the TLC-plates in a 1% ethanolic ninhydrin solution and heating on a hot plate. Radioactive spots were detected using a Berthold TraceMaster 20 automatic TLC linear analyser.

Radioisotope production [0080] No-carrier-added aqueous [18F]fluoride ion was produced via the [180(p,n)18F] nuclear reaction by irradiation of a 2 mL [180]water (> 97%-enriched, CortecNet, Paris, France) target on a IBA Cyclone-18/9 cyclotron (18 MeV proton beam) and was transferred to the appropriate hot cell. Target hardware: commercial, 2-mL, two-port, stainless steel target holder equipped with a domed-end niobium cylinder insert. Target to hot cell liquid-transfer system: 60 m PTFE line (0.8 mm internal diameter; 1/16 inch external diameter), 2.0 bar He drive pressure, transfer time 3-6 min. Typical production of [18F]Fluoride at the end of bombardment for a 20 μΑ, 30 min (10 pA.h) irradiation: 750-800 mCi (27.7-29.6 GBq). Miscellaneous [0081] Radiosyntheses using fluorine-18, including the HPLC purifications, were performed in a 7.5-cm-lead shielded cell using a computer assisted Zymate robot system (Zymark corporation, USA). Microwave activation was performed with a MicroWell 10 oven (2.45 GHz), Labwell AB, Sweden. Radiochemistrv Preparation of the Kfl§FlF-Kooo-complex [0082] In order to recover and recycle the [180]water target, the 2 mL of aqueous [18F]fluoride from the target holder were passed through an anion exchange resin (Sep-pak® Light Voters Accell ™ Plus QMA cartridge (initially in the chloride form, then washed with aq. 1M NaHCC>3 (2 mL) and rinsed with water (20 mL) and CH3CN (10 mL)) by helium pressure (1.5-2.0 bar). Helium was blown through the column to maximally extract the last traces of [180]water. The [18F]fluoride ion was then eluted from the resin, using an aq. K2CO3 solution (1.0 mL of a 1.0 mg/mL solution), into a Vacutainer ® tube containing Kryptofix®222 («222: 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicydo[8.8.8] hexacosane, 12.0 to 15.0 mg). The resulting solution was then gently concentrated to dryness at 145-150°C under a nitrogen stream for 10 min to give no-carrier-added K[18F]F-I<222 complex as a white semi-solid residue. Preparation of 8-//Ε1-4-Γ—Flfluoro-but-2-envh-3B-o-tolvl-8-aza-bicvclo-r3.2.11octane-2B-carboxvlic acid methyl ester tr^FI-10. Γ—F1LBT-9991. Zymate XP (Zymark) [0083] 1. A Procedure using conventional heating. DMSO (600 pL) containing 8-((E)-4-Chloro-but-2-enyl)-36-p-tolyl-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2P-carboxylic acid methyl ester (9, 3.5-4.5 mg, 10.0-12.9 pmol) were directly added into the Vacutainer® tube containing the dried K[18F]F-K222 complex The tube (not sealed) was thoroughly vortexed (30 s) and then placed in a heating block (at 90°C, for 10 min) without stirring the contents. The reaction vessel was then cooled using an ice-water bath, the remaining radioactivity measured (which was 96% to over 99% of the initial radioactivity) and the reaction mixture analyzed by radio-TLC. The reaction yield was calculated from the TLC-radiochromatogram and defined as the ratio of radioactivity area of [18F]LBT-999 ([^8F]-10) over total fluorine-18 radioactivity area (S1O2-TLC (EtOAc): Rf. [18F]-10 : 0.5 and Rf. [18F]fluoride ion : 0.0). The reaction mixture was diluted with water (1 mL) and transferred onto a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (PrepSep™ R-C18 Extraction Column, Fisher Scientific, activated beforehand with EtOH (2 mL) and then rinsed with water (10 mL)), pre-filled with water (2 mL). The tube was rinsed twice with water (1 mL), which was also transferred and added to the diluted reaction mixture on top of the cartridge (0.5-1.5% of the total radioactivity amount engaged in the fluorination process was lost in the initial tube). An additional portion of water (2 mL) was further added to the diluted reaction mixture on top of the cartridge. The whole was then passed through the cartridge, which was then washed with water (3 mL) and partially dried for 0.5 min by applying a nitrogen stream. [18F]-10 was eluted from the cartridge with CH2CI2 (3 mL) into an empty 5 mL reaction vial. Twice 1 mL of CH2CI2 was used to wash the cartridge (only 1-2% was left and lost on the cartridge) for maximal transfer of [18F]-10. 30-35% of the total radioactivity amount engaged in the fluorination process was eluted with CH2CI2 and was analysed by radio-HPLC (HPLC A). The incorporation yield was estimated after the C18 Sep-pak cartridge elution by the CH2CI2- over total eluted radioactivity (DMSO/H2O + CH2CI2) ratio. The resulting CH2CI2 solution was concentrated to dryness (at 65-75°C under a gentle nitrogen stream for 3-5 min). Finally, the above residue was redissolved in the HPLC solvent used for purification (1.0 mL) and the crude was injected onto HPLC (HPLC B). Isocratic elution gave pure [18F]-10 (iR: 12.5-13.5 min), well separated from unlabelled 9 (iR : 15.5- 17.5 min) and an unidentified fluorine-18-labelled impurity [18F]-11 (iR : 14.0-15.0 min). 2. ET Procedure using microwave activation. Same as procedure A, but instead of the heating block a dedicated microwave oven (at 100 Watt, for 2 min) was used. [0084] Formulation of [18F]LBT-999 ([18F]-10). Formulation of the labelled product for i.v. injection was effected as follows: The HPLC-collected fraction containing the radiotracer was diluted with water (50 mL). The resulting solution was passed through a Sep-pak®Plus C18 cartridge (Waters, washed with 2 mL of EtOH and then rinsed with 10 mL of water prior to use). The cartridge was washed with water (10 mL) and partially dried by applying a nitrogen stream for 10 s. The radiotracer was eluted with 2 mL of EtOH (less than 10% of the total radioactivity was left on the cartridge) followed by 8 mL of physiological saline and filtered on a 0.22 pm GS-Millipore filter (vented). Finally, physiological saline was added to lower the EtOH concentration below 10%. This whole process was performed using a remote-controlled dedicated home-made device based on a literature procedure (Lemaire C. etal., 1999). [0085] Quality control of fJ%lLBT-999 ffJ%l-10L The radiotracer preparation was visually inspected for clarity, absence of colour and particulates. An aliquot of the preparation was removed for determination of pH using standard pH-paper. Chemical and radiochemical purities were also assessed on this aliquot by HPLC (HPLC D), with a sample of authentic 10 (fR : 2.25 min) which synthesis and characterization were disclosed in Dollé F et al., 2006. Particular attention was paid to the absence of non-radioactive precursor 9 (tR: 3.45 min). Chemical and radiochemical stability of the entire preparation was tested by HPLC (HPLC D) at regular 15-min intervals during 120 min. Specific radioactivity of the radiotracer was calculated from three consecutive HPLC (HPLC D) analyses (average) and determined as follows: The area of the UV absorbance peak corresponding to the radiolabelled product was measured (integrated) on the HPLC chromatogram and compared to a standard curve relating mass to UV absorbance.

2257,ES-2644493-T3,A handover mechanism that exploits an uplink channel quality of a target cell ,2007,"5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 DESCRIPTION A handover mechanism that exploits an uplink channel quality of a target cell BACKGROUND I. Field [0001] The present specification refers in general to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a transfer mechanism or mechanisms for transferring a mobile terminal in a wireless communication system. II. Background [0002] Conventional technologies used to transmit information within a mobile communications network (for example, a mobile telephone network) include techniques based on frequency, time and code division. In general, with techniques based on frequency division, calls are split based on a frequency access procedure, in which the respective calls are placed on a different frequency. With time-based techniques, a certain portion of time is assigned to the respective calls on a designated frequency. With the techniques based on the division of code, the respective calls are associated with unique codes and propagated by the available frequencies. The respective technologies can accommodate multiple accesses of one or more users. [0003] More particularly, frequency division-based techniques typically separate the spectrum into different channels by dividing it into uniform bandwidth segments; For example, the division of the assigned frequency band for wireless mobile telephone communication can be divided into 30 channels, each of which can carry a voice conversation or, with digital service, carry digital data. Each channel can be assigned to only one user at a time. A commonly used variant is an orthogonal frequency division technique that effectively divides the total system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subbands. These subbands are also called tones, carriers, subcarriers, bins and frequency channels. Each subband is associated with a subcarrier that can be modulated with data. With time-based techniques, a band is divided into time in sequential time slots or time slots. Each user of a channel is provided with a time interval to transmit and receive information in ""round-robin"" mode. For example, at any given time t, a user is provided access to the channel during a short burst. Next, access changes to another user who is given a short time burst to transmit and receive information. The ""take turns"" cycle continues and, finally, multiple bursts of transmission and reception are provided to each user. [0004] The techniques based on the division of code typically transmit data through a number of frequencies available at any time in an interval. In general, the data is digitized and propagated by the available bandwidth, in which multiple users can overlap on the channel and a unique sequence code can be assigned to the respective users. Users can transmit in the same broadband segment of the spectrum, in which the signal of each user is propagated throughout the bandwidth by means of their respective unique propagation code. This technique can provide sharing, in which one or more users can transmit and receive simultaneously. Such sharing can be achieved by a digital modulation in spread spectrum, in which the bit stream of a user is encoded and propagated through a very wide channel in a pseudo-random manner. The receiver is designed to recognize the associated unique sequence code and undo the randomization in order to collect the bits for a particular user in a consistent manner. [0005] A typical wireless communication network (for example, employing frequency, time and code division techniques) includes one or more base stations that provide a coverage area and one or more mobile terminals (for example, wireless ) that can transmit and receive data within the coverage area. A typical base station can simultaneously transmit multiple data streams for broadcasting, multicast and / or unicast services, in which a data stream is a data stream that is of interest to be independently received for a mobile terminal. A mobile terminal within the coverage area of that base station may be interested in receiving one, more than one or all of the data streams carried by the composite stream. Also, a mobile terminal can transmit data to the base station or to another mobile terminal. Such communication between the base station and the mobile terminal or between mobile terminals may be degraded due to channel variations and / or interference power variations. For example, the mentioned variations may affect the programming of the base station, the power control and / or the prediction of the speed for one or more mobile terminals. [0006] In the preceding wireless communication systems, handover decisions are typically based on downlink channel (DL) quality metrics, for substantially any suitable metric, between the destination base station and the access terminal that is will pass. Said conventional approach to handover resolution does not incorporate uplink channel (UL) quality indications of the target cell. However, UL and dL in a typical wireless communication design may have characteristics 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 substantially disparate and, therefore, present an imbalance between the quality of the transmission and reception of UL and DL, generally referred to as link imbalance. In addition, disparate propagation environments for the UL and DL signal can cause other disparities in the quality of UL and DL channels. Therefore, handover decisions that are based only on a set of DL quality indications of a destination base station may be inadequate, especially in cases where the link quality imbalance is such that the condition of the DL channel may be above a threshold for handover, but UL channel conditions may be below that threshold. There is therefore a need in the art for a transfer mechanism or mechanisms that are based on the quality of DL and UL channel. [0007] WO 01/01720 refers to a transfer evaluated by the network assisted by mobile and base stations. The transfer determination is made by the quality of uplink and downlink communication between a mobile station MS and a first base station BS1 as compared to a second mobile station BS2. As the mobile station moves, it measures the BCH downlink conditions of a third base station BS3. The MS reports those measurement profiles from the downlink to an RNC radio network controller whenever the profile of a nearby cell exceeds a standard. The RNC informs the base station, such as BS3, that an MS has identified the base station as a possible base station for current or short-term communication. The RNC gives BS3 the instruction to measure the uplink transmission power received from the MS as it moves. At first, power control is only provided between MS and BS3 until BS3 informs the RNC that the uplink from MS is at an appropriate level. SUMMARY [0008] The aforementioned need is satisfied by the independent claims. The advantageous embodiments are contained in the dependent claims. [0009] A simplified summary is presented below in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed embodiments. This summary is not an exhaustive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements or delimit the scope of such modes of realization. Its purpose is to present some concepts of the ways of realization described in a simplified way as a prelude to the more detailed description that will be presented later. [0010] The system or systems and the procedure or procedures are provided for the transfer of a mobile terminal in a wireless communication system. The handover resolution is based on a downlink channel quality indication between a server base station and the mobile terminal, and uplink channel quality indications between the terminal and a measurement set of the destination base stations . To generate UL channel quality indicators, the mobile station carries a narrow-band or broadband polling reference signal, and the server and destination base stations measure performance metrics of UL and DL (for example, power received from the reference signal (RSRP), intensity indicator of the reference signal (RSSI) or reference signal on thermal noise (RSOT). In reverse handover, the UL channel status information from the target cells is received at the serving base station through the return communication, and the handover is resolved based on the UL and DL quality reports. In the direct handover, the set of UL quality reports are transported to the mobile station to determine a destination cell for the handover.

[0015] In one aspect, the present specification describes a procedure for facilitating handover in a wireless system, the method comprising: receiving uplink channel quality metrics (UL); save a transfer fitness score associated with a source of the received UL channel quality metrics; establish a transfer based, at least in part, on the UL channel metrics received and the channel quality metrics saved. [0016] In another aspect, the present specification discloses an apparatus operating in a wireless environment, the apparatus comprising: a processor configured to receive a set of uplink channel (UL) quality indicators; transport a probing reference signal; generate a set of downlink channel condition reports; resolve a transfer based, at least in part, on the set of UL channel metrics received; and a memory coupled to the processor. [0017] In another aspect, a wireless device is disclosed, the device comprising: means for receiving an uplink channel (UL) metric; means for determining a set of downlink channel (DL) conditions; means for storing a pass-through fitness score associated with a source of the received UL channel metric; means for establishing a transfer based, at least in part, on the received UL channel metric; and means for resolving a handover based, at least in part, on the metric of the received UL channel and the saved handover rating.

[0023] In addition, the term ""or"" refers to an ""or"" inclusive rather than an ""or"" exclusive. That is, unless otherwise specified, or clearly apparent from the context, the expression ""X uses A or B"" refers to any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X uses A; X uses B; or X uses both A and B, so ""X uses A or B"" is satisfied in any of the preceding cases. In addition, the articles ""a"" and ""a"" as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed as ""one or more"", unless otherwise specified or clearly derived from the context referred to. In a unique way. [0024] In this document various embodiments are described in relation to a wireless terminal. A wireless terminal may refer to a device that provides voice and / or data connectivity to a user. A wireless terminal can be connected to an information device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, or it can be an autonomous device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA).

Five fifty 55 60 65 used to communicate with a mobile device or devices and may also be called an access point, Node B, Node B evolved (eNodeB), or some other terminology. [0026] Referring below to the drawings, FIG. 1 is an illustration of a multiple access wireless communication system 100 according to various aspects. In one example, the multiple access wireless communication system 100 includes multiple base stations 110 and multiple terminals 120. In addition, one or more base stations 110 may communicate with one or more terminals 120. By way of non-limiting example, a base station 110 may be an access point, a Node B and / or other appropriate network entity.

As used herein and in general in the art, the term ""cell"" may refer to a base station 110 and / or its coverage area 102a-c depending on the context in which the term is used. [0027] To improve the capacity of the system, the coverage area 102a, 102b or 102c corresponding to a base station 110 can be partitioned into multiple smaller areas (for example, areas 104a, 104b and 104c).

In one example, sectors 104a, 104b, 104c of a cell 102a, 102b, 102c may be formed by groups of antennas (not shown) in base station 110, in which each group of antennas is responsible for communicating with terminals 120 in a portion of cell 102a, 102b or 102c. For example, a base station 110 serving cell 102a may have a first group of antennas corresponding to sector 104a, a second group of antennas corresponding to sector 104b and a third group of antennas corresponding to sector 104c. However, it should be appreciated that the various aspects disclosed in this document can be used in a system that has sectorized and / or non-sectorized cells. In addition, it should be noted that all suitable wireless communication networks that have any number of sectorized and / or non-sectorized cells belong to the scope of the claims attached to this document. For simplicity, the expression ""base station"" as used herein may refer to both to a station that serves a sector, and to a station that serves a cell. As it used herein, a ""service"" access point is one with which a terminal has transmissions of uplink traffic (data), and a ""near"" access point (which does not service) is one with which a terminal may have downlink traffic and / or uplink and uplink transmissions, but not uplink traffic. It should be noted that, as used herein, a downlink sector in a disjoint link scenario is a nearby sector. Although the following description generally refers to a system in which each terminal communicates with a service access point for reasons of simplicity, it should be appreciated that the terminals can communicate with any number of service access points. [0028] According to one aspect, terminals 120 may be scattered throughout the system 100. Each terminal 120 may be fixed or mobile. By way of non-limiting example, a terminal 120 may be an access terminal (AT), a mobile station, a user equipment, a subscriber station and / or another appropriate network entity. A terminal 120 may be a wireless device, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a portable device or other appropriate device. In addition, terminals 120 can communicate with any number of base stations 110 or with no base station 110 at any given time. [0029] In another example, the system 100 can use a centralized architecture using a system controller 130 that can be coupled to one or more base stations 110 and provide coordination and control for the base stations 110. According to alternative aspects, the controller System 130 can be a single network entity or a group of network entities. In addition, the system 100 can use a distributed architecture to allow the base stations 110 to communicate with each other as necessary. The return network communication 135 can facilitate point-to-point communication between base stations using such distributed architecture. In one example, system controller 130 may also contain one or more connections to multiple networks. These networks may include the Internet, other packet-based networks and / or circuit switched voice networks that can provide information to and / or from terminals 120 in communication with one or more base stations 110 in system 100. In another example, system controller 130 may include or be coupled to a programmer (not shown) that can schedule transmissions to and / or from terminals 120. Alternatively, the programmer may reside in each individual cell 102, each sector 104, or a combination thereof. [0030] In one example, the system 100 may use one or more multiple access schemes, such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OfDmA, single carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) and / or other suitable multiple access schemes. TDMA uses time division multiplexing (TDM), in which transmissions for different terminals 120 are orthogonalized by transmission at different time intervals. FDMA uses frequency division multiplexing (FDM), in which the transmissions for different terminals 120 are orthogonalized by transmission in different frequency subcarriers. In one example, TDMA and FDMA systems can also use code division multiplexing (CDM), in which transmissions for multiple terminals can 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 orthogonalized by different orthogonal codes (for example, Walsh codes) even if they are wrapped in the same time interval or subcarrier of frequency. OFDMA uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and SC-FDMA uses single carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM). OFDM and SC-FDM can partition the system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers (for example, tones, bins, ...), each of which can be modulated with data. Typically, the modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. In addition and / or alternatively, the system bandwidth can be divided into one or more frequency carriers, each of which may contain one or more subcarriers. System 100 can also use a combination of multiple access schemes, such as OFDMA and CDMA. Although the power control techniques provided herein are generally described for an OFDMA system, it should be appreciated that the techniques described herein can be applied in a similar manner to any wireless communication system. [0031] In another example, base stations 110 and terminals 120 of system 100 can communicate data through one or more data channels and signaling through one or more control channels. The data channels used by the system 100 can be assigned to the active terminals 120 so that each data channel is used by a single terminal at any given time. Alternatively, data channels can be assigned to multiple terminals 120, which can be superimposed or programmed orthogonally on a data channel. To conserve system resources, the control channels used by the system 100 can also be shared between multiple terminals 120 by, for example, code division multiplexing. In one example, data channels orthogonally multiplexed only in frequency and time (for example, data channels not multiplexed by CDM) may be less susceptible to loss of orthogonality due to channel conditions and receiver imperfections than channels. corresponding control. [0032] FIGs. 2A, 2B and 2C are, respectively, a block diagram of an example system that facilitates handover based on UL and DL channel conditions in accordance with aspects described herein; UL and DL measurement diagrams, and communication indicators carried during the operation of the system of FIG. 2A; and a block diagram of an example system that facilitates handover based on UL and DL channel conditions. [0033] FIG. 2A is a block diagram 200 of an example system that facilitates the direct transfer of a mobile station. In system 200, a service node 210 includes a CQI generator 212 and a sequence generator 214. Such components facilitate the generation of downlink (DL) broadband or narrowband downlink reference signals, which can be transmitted to the equipment. of user 230 for the generation of channel quality indications through the CQI 232 generator; The CQI of DL 226 is notified to eNode B 210 of service. The generation of DL channel conditions can be carried out periodically, the notification period of CQI can be determined by the traffic and the load in a cell that is covered by service eNode B 210. In addition, the notification period may depend on the notified DL channel conditions, in order to ensure that the precise DL 226 CQI is received in the service eNode B 210. In addition, the generation and notification of CQI of DL 226 can be activated by event, for example, an additional wireless device enters the coverage area of eNode B 210, an access terminal in a nearby cell transmits a burst of data that increases substantially Another interference from the sector increases the size of a data buffer (for example, which resides in memory 218) and the communication resources for UE 230, or a disparate UE, need an adjustment, etc. [0034] In addition to receiving the DL 226 CQI from the UE 230, the service eNode B receives a reference polling signal (SRS) from UL 228, which can be a sequence transmitted in a narrow band (eg, 1 , 08 MHz, as in the case of a RACH sounding signal) or a broadband. (It should be noted that the UL sRs is generated by the sequence generator 234, which operates in substantially the same way as the sequence generator 214.) The probe signal is used by the service eNode B 210 to carry out measurements of UL channel conditions (for example, signal strength, C / I ratios, and the like), which can be used as a reference metric in a handover algorithm, which can reside in memory 222 and can be executed by the processor 216 to resolve the handover of UE 230 according to aspects that will be analyzed later. A UL channel condition report can be stored in memory 218 if necessary. The UL measurements on the service eNode B can be carried out by the CQI 212 generator, which functions as the CQI 232 generator. [0035] In one aspect, user equipment 230 also transports the SRS of UL 2421-242n to a set of destination nodes 2501-250n (N: a positive integer). Each of the destination base stations 2501-250N can use the received UL polling channels to perform UL measurements and determine a UL channel condition report. Once the UL 262 measurements have been completed, the results are transported to service eNode B 210. In one aspect, said communication occurs through the return network 260, or interface X2 in LTE. In this way, the service eNode B 210 can have access to the UL channel conditions, for the UL belonging to the service node and for the UL belonging to the measurement set of the destination eNode Bs 2501-250n-. It should be appreciated that the uplink channel status information and the DL channel quality estimates are available for the service eNode 210. Therefore, using an algorithm of 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 handover in memory 222, service base station 210 can resolve the handover of user equipment 230 based, at least in part, on UL and DL channel quality information. It should be noted that the latter can remedy issues such as the UL / DL link imbalance and can also take into account the different transfer limits for UL and DL, particularly in cases where the signal on these channels is propagated differently as in the case of FDD systems with a substantial disparity in operating frequencies. [0036] In another aspect, the server base station 210 can carry the {SRS of UL} i-n 266 generated by the user equipment 230, and the {communication indicators} 1-N 264 comprising various system information. It should be appreciated that (i) providing UL SRS through a return communication can reduce cellular traffic, which is beneficial for the QoS of disparate access terminals. In addition, in case of poor channel conditions, point-to-point communication through return 260 ensures adequate reception in the destination cells. In addition, the transport of said system information facilitates the indirect presynchronization, or the approximate synchronization, of the eNode Bs of destination 2501-250n with the user equipment 230, to prepare for the handover. The UL and DL measurements and the communicator indicators broadcast through the return network are presented below. [0037] It should be noted that processors 218 and 236 are configured to perform at least a portion of the functional actions, for example, calculations, necessary to implement the functionality of substantially any component of base station 210 and UE 230, respectively . Memories 218 and 238 can save respective data structures, code instructions, algorithms, and the like, which can be used by the respective processors 216 and 236 when they confer to the base station 210 or the UE 230 their functionality. [0038] FIG. 2B represents information that can be collected by measurements of UL 272. This information includes: the reference power of the broadband or narrowband probe reference signal (SRS) indicates the intensity of the signal (Es) and reveals the loss, or attenuation, per UL path associated with the attenuation of the radiation transported in the UL channel; SRS broadband or narrowband intensity indicator, which typically carries the interference effects, which indicates the intensity of a signal with respect to the average background noise, for example, Es / I0, the measured background noise includes the intracellular and intercellular interference; SRS over thermal broadband or narrowband noise, typically transported as Es / N0. In addition, block 274 represents the information collected through DL measurements: RSRP and RSSI. It should be noted that DL RSSP and DL RSSI have been conventionally used by a service base station to resolve the handover of an access terminal. It should also be noted that the channel conditions collected by UL and DL measurements are generally disparate. In particular, in LTE, an UL RSRP indication (for example, Q offset) related to the loss per path in the broadcasting channel is transmitted, while the UL RSSI related to cell / variable sector interference can be transported between the server base stations through the return communication 260. [0039] Block 276 of FIG. 2B represents communication indicators that can be used by a measurement set of base stations (for example, 2501-250n); namely, system bandwidth which, in LTE for example, can comprise multiple values ranging from 1.25 MH to 20 MHz; pilot sequences used in broadband and narrowband polling reference signals; CQI channel directives that determine the repetition factors of CQI reports and the frequency, or periodicity, of the determination of channel quality indications (for example, DL or UL measurements such as those represented in 274 and 272); cell timing of DL, in particular in asynchronous systems; and Ul timing delay with respect to DL communications. [0040] FIG. 2C is a block diagram 280 of an example system that facilitates the reverse transfer of an access terminal. System 280 has substantially the same functionality as system 200. In order to provide direct handover capabilities, in system 280, user equipment 230 receives reports of UL channel status information. In one aspect, said reports are received as a set of differential quality indicator {ACQIul} 1-n 275 for the eNode Bs of destination 2501-250n; the differential metric is relative to an uplink channel quality metric for server base station 210; namely, \ cniU) - cni {TARGET) _ rni {SERV1NG) ul ul »where A = 1,2, ..., N. In addition to receiving quality indications of UL channel for destination cells 2501-250N, it should be appreciated that UE 230 can generate reports of DL channel conditions through cQl generator 232. In addition, user equipment 230 can resolve direct handover using an algorithm of handover that resides in memory 222 and the UL CQl available in memory 278. It should be noted that although memories 22 and 278 are illustrated as a different memory platform, said memories may reside within memory 238. [0041] It should be noted that processor 236 is configured to perform at least a portion of the functional actions, for example, calculations, necessary to implement the functionality of substantially any component of UE 230. Memory 238 can store data structures, code instructions, algorithms and the like, which can be used by processor 236 when conferring its functionality to UE 230. 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 [0042] FIG 3 is a block diagram of an example system that facilitates direct handover based, at least in part, on an HO procedure that is based on an HO fitness score associated with a destination eNode B . In system 300, a user equipment comprises a handover component 315 that can resolve (for example, grant or deny) the handover to destination eNode B 380. To grant or deny a handover, the UE 310 generates reference signals of UL 377 probing through sequence generator 325 in substantially the same manner as discussed above in relation to sequence generator 234. In one aspect, the SRS of UL 377 is transported at a power greater than AP dBm with respect to to a reference signal transported to the EU service signal, to ensure that the propagation of the UL SRS encompasses several levels of the nearby eNode Bs (eg, destination eNode B 380). As discussed above, UL SRS can be transmitted through a narrowband channel, for example, RACH in LTE, for a specific period, such as M subframes or Q slots. Also, to avoid collisions, disparate UEs can transmit UL SRS in disparate time-frequency resources; Typically, it is desired to avoid the collision since it can mitigate the degradation of the typical battery associated with the transport of the reference signals. [0043] The SRS reference signals of UL 377 are used by a CQI 385 generator to estimate, for example, by measurements, the UL channel conditions (eg RSRP, RSSI or RSOT) that are notified to UE 310 in the downlink as CQIul 379. To improve the estimates of the channel condition made by the CQI generator 385, the UE 310 can repeat the UL SRS up to P times; however, the transfer component 315 can limit the value of P to a maximum value P max which ensures adequate compensation between the advantage of receiving more accurate CQIul reports and the capacity, or traffic flow, of the cell / sector, and the battery costs associated with increasing the cell charge by substantive repetition of the UL SRS sequence. In one aspect, the handover component 315 may be based on an intelligent component (not shown) to adaptively find an optimal Pmax value based, at least in part, on changes in cell / sector interference, traffic and metrics of load. In an alternative or additional aspect, in order to avoid undue loading of a narrowband or broadband channel carrying the SRS of UL 377, the UE 310 may be based on an HO (a) fitness score associated with an eNode B of destination 380, so that the SRS of UL 377 is transmitted in cases where a> aTH, where aTH is the punctuation threshold. Such punctuation can be adapted, increasing or decreasing, according to notified UL channel conditions, for example, cQIul379. In one aspect, the handover component 315 can modify the magnitude of a stored a associated with a specific eNode B according to a predetermined algorithm, for example, a function f (), which can be stored in a handover algorithm memory 355 The HO fitness score can be stored in an HO 335 fitness storage. In one aspect, the algorithm, or the function, f () may depend on the historical values of a stored in memory 335, as well as the Current communication conditions (traffic, interference, etc.). In addition, the handover component 315 may use an intelligent component (not shown) to adapt the tuning algorithm to a. [0044] To resolve a direct handover to a destination cell (for example, destination eNode B 380), the handover component may be based on CQI reports received in the UE. Once a handover has taken place, the user equipment 310 can adjust the synchronization with the current serving cell. [0045] It should be noted that processor 365 is configured to perform at least a portion of the functional actions, for example, calculations, necessary to implement the functionality of substantially any component of UE 310; for example, the transfer component 315, an intelligent component residing therein, etc. The memory 375 can store data structures, code instructions, algorithms and the like, which can be used by the processor 365 by conferring on the UE 310 its functionality. [0046] As previously used herein, in relation to the adaptation of HO proficiency scores, and in other parts of this description, the term ""intelligence"" refers to the ability to reason or take out conclusions on, for example, to deduce, the current or future state of a system based on the existing information about the system. Artificial intelligence can be used to identify a specific context or action, or to generate a distribution of the probability of specific states of a system without human intervention. Artificial intelligence is based on the application of advanced mathematical algorithms - for example, decision trees, neural networks, regression analysis, cluster analysis, genetic algorithms and reinforced learning - to a set of available data (information) in the system. [0047] In particular, for the achievement of the various automated aspects described above and other automated aspects related to the innovation of the invention described herein, an intelligent component (not shown) may employ one of the numerous methodologies for learning. from data and then draw conclusions from the asf models constructed, for example, hidden Markov models (HMM) and related prototype dependence models, more general probabilistic graphic models, such as Bayesian networks, for example , created by searching for structures using a punctuation or approximation of Bayesian models, linear classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVM), nonlinear classifiers, such as the so-called ""neural network"" methodologies, fuzzy logic methodologies , and other approaches that perform data fusion, etc. [0048] FIG. 4 is a block diagram 400 of an embodiment of a transmitter system 410 (such as 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 Node B 210) and a receiver system 450 (for example, access terminal 230) in a system of multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) that can provide communication of cells (or sectors) in a wireless environment according to one or more aspects presented in this document. In the transmitter system 410, traffic data can be provided for a number of data streams from a data source 412 to a transmission data processor (TX) 414. In one embodiment, each data stream is transmitted through of a respective transmission antenna. The TX 414 data processor formats, encodes and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide encoded data. The encoded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. Pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and that can be used in the receiving system to estimate the channel response. Next, the multiplexed pilot and encoded data for each data stream is modulated (for example, the assignment of symbols) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase shift modulation (BPSK), quadrature phase shift modulation (QPSK), multiple phase shift modulation (M-PSK) or multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) selected for that data flow to provide modulation symbols. The speed, coding and modulation of data for each data stream can be determined by instructions executed by the processor 430, the instructions as well as the data can be stored in memory 432. [0049] Next, the modulation symbols for all data streams are provided to a MIMO TX 420 processor, which can further process the modulation symbols (eg, OFDM). Next, the MIMO TX 420 processor provides Nt modulation symbol streams to the Nt transceivers (TMTR / RCVR) 422a to 422t. In certain embodiments, the MIMO TX 420 processor applies beam conformation weights (or precoding) to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted. Each transceiver 422 receives and processes a respective flow of symbols to provide one or more analog signals and also treats (for example, amplifies, filters and performs the upstream conversion of) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission through MIMO channel. Next, the modulated Nt signals of transceivers 422a to 422t are transmitted from the Nt antennas 4241 to 424t, respectively. In the receiver system 450, the transmitted modulated signals are received by the Nr antennas 4521 to 452r and the signal received from each antenna 452 is provided to a respective transceiver (RCVR / TMTR) 454a to 454r. Each 4541-454r transceiver treats (for example, filters, amplifies and performs the down conversion of) a respective received signal, digitizes the treated signal to provide samples and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding flow of ""received"" symbols. [0050] Next, an RX 460 data processor receives and processes the Nr symbol streams received from the Nr transceivers 4541-454r based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide Nt streams of ""detected"" symbols. Next, the RX 660 data processor demodulates, deinterleaves and decodes each symbol stream detected to retrieve the traffic data for the data stream. The processing of the RX 460 data processor is complementary to that performed by the MIMO TX 620 processor and the TX 414 data processor in the transmitter system 410. A 470 processor periodically determines which precoding matrix to use; such an array can be stored in memory 672. The processor 670 formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a range value portion. Memory 472 can store instructions that, when executed by processor 670, result in the formulation of the reverse link message. The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and / or the flow of data received, or a combination thereof. In particular, said information may comprise a report or channel quality indicator reports (such as CQI of DL 226 or {UL measurements} 1-n 262), a lag to adjust a scheduled resource or probing reference signals for the estimate of the link (or channel). Next, the reverse link message is processed by a TX 438 data processor, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 436, modulated by a modulator 480, treated by transceivers 454a to 454r and transmitted back to transmitter system 410. [0051] In the transmitter system 410, the modulated signals of the receiver system 450 are received by the antennas 4241-624t, treated by the transceivers 422a-422t, demodulated by a demodulator 440 and processed by an RX 442 data processor to extract the Reverse link message transmitted by the receiving system 450. Next, the processor 430 determines which precoding matrix to use to determine the weights of the beam conformation and processes the extracted message. [0052] A mobile station 230 can be programmed to operate in SIMO, SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO, depending at least in part on the channel quality indicators notified by said receiver. Next, the communication in these modes of operation is described. It is observed that in the SIMo mode a single antenna is used in the receiver (N r = 1) for communication; Therefore, SIMO operation can be interpreted as a special case of SU-MIMO. The single user MIMO mode of operation corresponds to the case in which a single receiver system 450 communicates with the transmitter system 610, as illustrated above in FIG. 4 and in accordance with the operation described in relation thereto. In such a system, the Nt transmitters 4241-424t (also known as TX antennas) and the Nr receivers 4521-452r (also known as RX antennas) form a MIMO matrix channel (e.g., Rayleigh channel, or Gaussian channel, with slow fade or fast) to 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 Wireless communication As mentioned above, the SU-MIMO channel is described by an NrxNt matrix of random complex numbers. The channel range is equal to the algebraic range of the NrxNt matrix, which in terms of space-time, or spatial frequency coding, the range is equal to the number Nv ^ min {NT, Nr} of data streams (or layers ) independent that can be sent through the SU-MIMO channel without causing interference between flows. [0053] In one aspect, in the SU-MIMO mode, the symbols transmitted / received with OFDM, in the tone w, can be modeled by: and (w) - H (to) c (co) + n (co). (2) Here, and (w) is the data stream received and is a vector Nrx1, H (w) is the channel response matrix NrxNt in the tone w (for example, the Fourier transform of the dependent channel response matrix of time h), c (w) is an output symbol vector Ntx1, and n (w) is a noise vector Nrx1 (for example, additive Gaussian white noise). The precoding can convert an Nvx1 layer vector into an Ntx1 precoding output vector. Nv is the actual number of data streams (layers) transmitted by transmitter 410 and Nv can be programmed at the discretion of the transmitter (for example, transmitter 410, Node B 410 or access point 210) based, at least in part, on conditions channel (for example, CQI notified according to a notification approach established by a service access point) and the range notified in a programming request by a terminal (for example, receiver 450). It should be noted that c (w) is the result of at least one multiplexing scheme, and at least one precoding scheme (or beam formation) applied by the transmitter. In addition, c (w) can be convolved with a power gain matrix, which determines the amount of power that transmitter 410 allocates to transmit each data stream Nv. It should be appreciated that such a power gain matrix can be a resource that is assigned to a terminal (for example, access terminal 230, receiver 450 or UE 230) through a programmer in the service node in response, at least in party, to a notified CQI. [0054] As mentioned above, according to one aspect, the MU-MIMO operation of a set of terminals belongs to the scope of the innovation of the invention. In addition, the programmed MU-MIMO terminals work in conjunction with SU-MIMO terminals and SIMO terminals. FIG. 5 illustrates an example multi-user MIMO system 500 in which three AT 550p, 550u and 550s, incorporated into receivers substantially the same as receiver 550, communicate with transmitter 510, which incorporates a Node B. It should be appreciated that the operation of the system 500 is representative of the operation of virtually any group of wireless devices programmed in the MU-MIMO operation within a server cell by a centralized programmer residing in a service access point. As mentioned above, transmitter 410 has Nt TX antennas 4241-424t, and each of the ATs has multiple RX antennas; namely, ATp has Np antennas 4521-452p, APu has Nu antennas 4521-452u and APs has Ns antennas 4521-452s. The communication between terminals and the access point is made through the uplinks 515p, 515u and 515s. Similarly, downlinks 510p, 510u and 510s facilitate communication between Node B 410 and terminals ATp, ATu and ATs, respectively. In addition, the communication between each terminal and the base station is implemented in substantially the same way, through substantially the same components, as illustrated in FIG. 4 and is analyzed in the description of it. [0055] The terminals may be located in substantially different locations within the cell served by the access point 410, whereby each user equipment 450p, 650u and 650s has its own MIMO matrix channel ha and matrix Ha response (a = P, U and S), with its own range (or, equivalently, decomposition into singular values) and its own associated channel quality indicator. Due to the plurality of users present in the cell served by the base station 410, there may be intracellular interference and may affect the CQI values reported by each of the 450p 450u and 450s terminals. [0056] Although illustrated with three terminals in FIG. 5, it should be appreciated that a MU-MIMO system can comprise substantially any number of terminals; each of said terminals is indicated below with an index k. According to various aspects, each of the access terminals 450p, 450u and 450s can notify the CQI to Node B 410. Such terminals can notify the CQI of one or more antennas, using a cyclic or parallel notification approach. The frequency and spectral characteristics, for example, which subbands, of said notification can be determined by service Node B 410. In addition, Node B 410 can dynamically reprogram each of the terminals 450p, 450u and 450s in a mode of disparate operation, such as SU-MIMO or SISO, and establish a disparate directive or notification policies for each of the terminals. [0057] In one aspect, the symbols transmitted / received with OFDM, in the tone w and for the user k, can be modeled by: yk (w) - Hk (to) ck (a>) + Hk (w) £ 'cm (co) + nk (co). (3) Here, the symbols have the same meaning as in Eq. (1). It should be noted that due to the multi-user diversity, the interference of another user in the signal received by the user k is modeled with the second term 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 on the left side of Eq. (2). The main symbol (') indicates that the transmitted symbol vector Ck is excluded from the summation. The terms of the series represent the reception by the user k (through his Hk channel response) of the symbols transmitted by a transmitter (for example, access point 210) to the other users of the cell.

Although, to simplify the explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it should be understood and appreciated that the subject matter claimed is not limited by the number or order of the blocks, since some blocks may appear in orders differently and / or simultaneously to other blocks of what is represented and described in this document.

Those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. [0060] FIG. 6 presents a flow chart of a procedure 600 for resolving the reverse handover based, at least in part, on UL channel conditions of a target cell. In general, the procedure 600 can be operated by a base station to determine the reverse transfer of an access terminal that is serviced. In 610, a measurement set is determined. The determination of a measurement can take place through a cell / system search. Said cell acquisition can be carried out at a time when a performance metric or transfer metric (for example, an interference-thermal noise ratio, a signal-interference ratio, a signal-to-noise ratio, a signal-interference relationship and noise, etc.) for the UL and DL channel reaches a predetermined threshold value. For example, the threshold value that triggers the determination of a measurement set can be based, at least in part, on a QoS indicator, such as cell performance, maximum data rate, minimum data rate, cell capacity / sector, communication latency, and the like. Alternatively, a service provider can predetermine a measurement set based on the location of the user equipment. In 620, a measurement set is stored, typically in a memory associated with a serving base station. [0061] In 630, a set of communication indicators, such as those represented in FIG. 2B, is transported to a set of cells in the measurement set. At 640, a set of Ul channel condition metrics is received from the set of cells in the measurement set. In addition, these metrics can be received periodically, or they can be activated by event; for example, a specific cell / sector load level is reached, a specific intracellular or intercellular interference level is detected, a new system information is programmed, etc. In a further aspect, the UL channel condition metrics are received through return communication (for example, interface X2 in LTE). Such communication benefits from being substantially insensitive to the conditions of the communication channel, since communication is point to point between the base stations (for example, 2301 and 260) through the backbone of a cable or fiber network optics. For example, the T1 / E1 lines or other links of the carrier-T / carrier-E protocol and / or the packet-based Internet protocol. The wired nature of the return communication interface can ensure that UL performance is received and processed correctly. [0062] In 650, the set of UL channel condition metrics are transported to the mobile station (MS). In 660, a set of downlink channel conditions is received from the mobile station. Typically, the station 5 10 fifteen twenty 25 30 35 40 Four. Five fifty 55 60 65 mobile that notifies the conditions of DL channel is the mobile station that can experience the transfer. In action 670, the transfer of the MS is resolved based, at least in part, on the UL and DL channel conditions received. [0063] FIGs. 7A and 7B present flowcharts of the 700 and 750 example procedures to collect respectively, UL and Dl channel condition metrics. In 710, a set of uplink channel condition metrics, or handover metrics, is measured. Such metrics generally comprise those represented in FIG. 2B. In one aspect, such channel condition metrics can be measured periodically, in a cycle comprising a specific number of slots, frames or superframes, or it can be measured once a predetermined event occurs. In another aspect, the measurements can be temporarily averaged over a specific number of temporary resources or frequency resources (for example, a subband). In addition, the UL channel condition metrics can also be determined as an average over a specific set of time-frequency resources, such as resource blocks. At 720, the set of UL channel condition metrics is transported. With respect to FIG. 7b, actions 760 and 770 have substantially the same scope as actions 710 and 720, but measurements are made on the downlink. [0064] FIG. 8 presents a flowchart of a procedure 800 for establishing direct handover based, at least in part, on UL channel conditions. In 810, a set of UL channel condition metrics, or handover metrics, is received for the cells in a measurement set. In 820, a set of DL channel condition metrics is determined for the cells in the measurement set. In 830, the (direct) transfer to a target cell in the measurement set is established based, at least in part, on the UL channel conditions received and DL channel conditions (for example, by procedure 750) are determined . [0065] FIG. 9 presents a flow chart of an example procedure 900 for determining the handover (HO) based, at least in part, on an HO fitness score and UL channel conditions. In 910, one or more validation checks are carried out to assess whether a destination eNode B (for example, 280j; FIG. 2) has an HO fitness score greater than a predetermined threshold. Such fitness score is a function f () of a differential channel quality between the destination eNode B and a service eNode B: - rnr (TARGET) _ rni (SEm, NG) UL The threshold can be determined according to various criteria, such such as (i) historical data on CQI of the cells in a measurement set, (ii) seasonal values for CQI in a coverage area comprising the service and destination eNodeB, (iii) load or traffic of the cell / sector , (iv) cellular interference, (v) level of service (for example, premium user, promotional user, sporadic user, ...) of a user operating a mobile station that will undergo a transfer, etc. Once a destination eNode B satisfies the criteria imposed in 910, a UL probe reference signal is transported to the destination eNodeB in 920. In 930, the presence of a response is probed and, in the absence of a response, the destination eNode B is classified as ""non-preferred"", or substantially any other qualification that conveys the notion that the probed destination eNode B does not notify channel conditions; for example, it can also be used ""no answer"". In case an answer is received, the fitness score is updated according to f (ACQI) associated with the destination eNode B. Such an update may include increasing the HO fitness score or decreasing it. In action 960, the response received is associated with a UL channel condition for the destination eNode B. [0066] In 970, the transfer to the destination eNode B is determined based, at least in part, on a current (for example, updated) value of the HO fitness score and the UL channel condition of the destination eNode B . In one aspect, the determination can be carried out in accordance with a handover algorithm associated with a service eNode B, in which case the handover becomes an inverse handover. Alternatively, the determination in 970 can be carried out by an access terminal and the transfer achieved is a direct transfer. It should be appreciated that performing a reverse handover can exacerbate latency problems, while carrying out a direct handover may result in the reduction of the latency problem at the expense of greater complexity of the user equipment. [0067] FIG. 10 illustrates a block diagram of a system 1000 that allows direct handover in accordance with aspects described herein. System 1000 may include a module 1010 to receive a set of uplink channel (UL) quality metrics through a return communication interface; a module 1020 to generate a UL channel quality indication; a module 1030 to receive a set of downlink channel (DL) conditions; a module 1040 for resolving the handover based, at least in part, on the UL channel quality metrics received and the set of DL channel quality indications; a module 1050 for generating an UL channel quality indication that includes means for measuring at least one of a reference power of the reference signal of the probe (SRS), intensity indicator of the SRS or SRS on thermal noise; a module 1060 for transporting the set of UL channel quality metrics over a wireless link; and a module 1070 for transporting at least one of the UL channel quality metrics in the set of UL channel quality metrics over a wireless link when the at least one metric is above a metric threshold.

2279,AT-505455-B1,BEARING SHELL OF A SLIDE BEARING ,2007,"2 AT 505 455 B1 The invention relates to a bearing shell of a sliding bearing for sliding support of a shaft, with a sliding surface which surrounds the shaft to be supported over at least part of its circumference and is located on the shell of a cylinder with a radius in the range of 28 mm and 34 mm. and side surfaces, at least one of which is provided with a recess which, viewed in axial longitudinal section through the bearing shell lying on a straight first wall portion which extends from the side surface at a distance from the longitudinal axis of the bearing shell and forms an angle with the longitudinal axis of the bearing shell , A further away from the longitudinal axis, seen in axial longitudinal section lying on a first wall portion parallel straight second wall portion which has a normal distance to the first wall portion, and in axial longitudinal section seen arcuate third and fourth wall portion comprises, of which the third wall portion connects tangentially to the first wall portion and has a diameter and of which the fourth wall portion connects tangentially to the second wall portion and has a diameter, wherein the third and fourth wall portion tangentially connect to each other and the depth of the recess is defined by the normal distance between the side surface of the Bearing shell and the intersection of the line on which the second wall portion is located, with the perpendicular to this straight line, applied to the bottom of the recess tangent. It is known bearing shells of plain bearings, z. B. in plastic processing machines, arranged in side surfaces of the bearing shells recesses or punctures. Such a recess serves to reduce the loads occurring in the region of the relevant axial end of the sliding surface, for example by tilting moments or vibrations exerted on the mounted shaft. Such a recess is defined by a number of parameters. Usually, the shape and size of the recess is determined on the basis of technical considerations, wherein the dependencies of the occurring load variables of the individual parameters of the recess can not be deduced directly. The parameters of the recess are thus far from optimized. One way to optimize the parameters is to conduct intensive parameter studies. This is particularly limited in a variety of product parameters feasible and very time consuming and costly. The object of the invention is to provide an improved bearing shell of the type mentioned. According to the invention, this is achieved by a bearing shell having the features of claim 1. The bearing shell formed in the manner according to the invention achieves a substantial reduction in the values of the load variables compared to known bearing shells, with the corresponding positive influence on the expected service life. By means of the method explained in the description, an improved parameter set can be found with a relatively small number of steps, by means of which target values for load variables can be reached or at least approximated. It is a data-based approach in which a dependency model for determining dependencies between at least some parameters and the load variables or at least one of these parameters resulting distance from target values for the load variables is obtained from a number of data sets. Such methods are also referred to as ""data mining"" methods, which are known in particular for economic applications. Data mining methods are known, for example, from ""Geoffrey Holmes, Mark Hall, Eibe Frank: Generating Rule Sets from Model Trees: Twelfth Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1-12, 1999"" and ""Y. Wang, I. H. Witten: Induction of model trees for predicting continuous classes. In: Poster papers of the 9th European Conference on Machine Learning, 1997 "".

The sliding bearing comprises in the illustrated embodiment four bearing shells 2, wherein a larger or smaller number of bearing shells 2 is possible. A respective bearing shell 2 has a sliding surface 3 which surrounds the shaft 1 to be supported over its circumference. The sliding surface 3 is in this case on the jacket of an imaginary cylinder, wherein it has a distance r from the longitudinal axis 4. The radius r of the sliding surface 3 is in this case 28 mm. At the two axial ends of the sliding surface 3 of the bearing shell 2 are side surfaces 5, 6 of the bearing shell 2, wherein one of these side surfaces 5 is shown in Fig. 3 in greater detail. The side surfaces 5, 6 are at an angle, preferably at right angles, to the longitudinal axis 4. The sliding surface 3 of a respective bearing shell 2 could surround the shaft 1 only over a part of its circumference, wherein in the circumferential direction also two or more bearing shells could be present, the sliding surfaces together the shaft 3 is substantially surrounded by 360 °. In the side surfaces 5, 6 recesses 7 are introduced, which extend in the region lying radially within the sliding surface 3. Through these recesses 7 a better absorption or dissipation of the forces occurring in the axial end regions of the bearing shells 2 is achieved. These recesses 7, which are rotationally symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal axis 4, are defined by the following parameters: A first wall portion 8 of the recess 7 is in axial longitudinal section (= section parallel to the longitudinal axis 4 and through this, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3) seen on a straight line. This is based on the side surface 5 at a distance R from the longitudinal axis 4, wherein it forms an angle W with the longitudinal axis 4. A second wall section 9 is seen in axial longitudinal section also on a straight line which is parallel to the straight line on which the first wall section 8 is located. The second wall section 9 is further away from the longitudinal axis 4 (at the same normal distance from the side surface 5) and has a normal distance B from the first wall section 8. A seen in axial longitudinal section circular arc-shaped extending third wall portion 10 connects tangentially to the first wall portion 8 and has a diameter Dl (""inner diameter""). A fourth wall section 11 extends in the form of an arc in the axial longitudinal section and connects tangentially to the second wall section 9, wherein it has a diameter DA (""outer diameter""). The third and fourth wall sections 10, 11 tangentially engage each other, i. H. the tangents coincide at one point. Furthermore, the depth T of the recess 7 is defined by the normal distance between the side surface 5 and the intersection between the straight line along which the second wall section 9 extends, with the tangent 12 perpendicular to this straight line is applied to the bottom of the recess 7, ie to the third or fourth wall portion 10, eleventh The recess 7 is completely defined by these parameters, ie the distance R, the angle W, the normal distance B, the diameter Dl and DA and the depth T. For the sliding bearing high demands are placed on the service life and the effective load collective. Authoritative sizes are u. a. the contact pressure and friction stress between the bearing shell and the shaft and von-Mises tension, which must be as small as possible for a long service life. These load variables are strongly influenced by the parameters of the recess. Target values are specified for the load variables. The load collective defined thereby should be undercut or at least approximated by a suitable choice of the parameters. In the exemplary embodiment, for the von-Mises tension x1 = 500 MPa, for the contact pressure x2 = 200 MPa and for the friction stress x3 = 30 MPa are specified as target values. Now a first data record with values of the parameters defining the groove is defined. The choice of initial parameters individual parameters can be based on experience and / or technical considerations. In Fig. 5, this first record is included in the first row of the illustrated table. As a next step, the values of the load variables resulting from these parameter values are determined. This determination preferably takes place mathematically, in particular by calculating an FEM model (""finite element method""). Thereby, the values of the load variables x1, x2, x3 indicated in the first row of the table of FIG. 5 are obtained. The values of the parameters together with the obtained values of the load quantities form the first complete data set. It would also be conceivable and possible, for example, to produce a workpiece with a recess in accordance with the parameter data set and to determine the load variables by measurement. Subsequently, several more complete data records are determined. In this case, one or more parameters are varied in each case and the values of the load variables are determined for the respective parameter data record. Such further total data sets are contained in lines 2 to 24 of the table of FIG. 5. In order to allow a simpler evaluation of a respective parameter data set, the original, here three-dimensional target space is mapped onto a one-dimensional target space. In this case, the distance y to the target vector (target point in the target area) is determined in accordance with the target values of the load variables, correspondingly For further simplification, in the exemplary embodiment shown, individual parameters are first to be set to defined values. As a result, a substantial reduction in the dimension of the parameter space is achieved in order to subsequently determine values for the remaining variable parameters. The determination of parameters to specific values is made for those parameters for which the most obvious tendencies can be ascertained. For ease of recognizing such tendencies, for example, the data sets in a parallel representation, as shown in Fig. 4, are displayed. The values of the individual parameters are connected by a line and the nature (or color) of the line is coded according to the distance y belonging to this data set to the target vector. In Fig. 4, the records 1 to 24 are shown in the table of Fig. 5. By interpreting the parallel representation corresponding to Fig. 4, the following parameters were set as follows: Distance R = 31 mm; Angle W = 50 °; Depth T = 4.7 mm. This is an assumption that with these values an overall parameter set can be formed, which leads to sufficiently good load variables. If this assumption should not be fulfilled, these provisionally determined parameters would have to be changed later. While these aforementioned parameters are left unchanged, the remaining three parameters (B, Dl, DA) are varied and the values of the load variables and the distance y from the destination point respectively are determined. This results in the records 25 to 28 of the table of FIG. 5. On the basis of the available overall datasets, a data-based model is now produced by means of a data-mining method on the principle of ""divide and rule"". Such data mining methods are basically known, for example from the state of the art mentioned in the introduction to the description. This represents a dependency model for the dependence between values of the not yet fixed parameters and the approximation to the target values of the load values achieved by these values, this approximation here being expressed by the size of the distance y to the target point. In the premisses (IF) of the data-based model, the parameter area is partitioned and described in the consequences (THEN) with local linear models. Below is the model consisting of six rules with width B, inner diameter Dl and outer diameter DA and the distance y to the target point listed. Rule 1: IFβ> 4.25D / &lt; 11 THEN y = -0.4791 ß - 0.0144Dl + 3.1415 Rule 2: IF ß &gt; 4.25 DA &gt; 1.5 THEN y = -0.9861 β - 0.0422Dl - 0.2351 DA + 6.1025 Rule 3: IF DA <1.3 THEN y = -1.3829β - 0.053D / - 0.3434DA + 8.1813 Rule 4: IFD / &lt; 11.5 THEN y = -2.8626β - 0.1015Dl + 13.9136 Rule 5: IFβ &lt; 3.95 THEN y = -2.6242ß + 11.3787 Rule 6 (Default): y = 0.7455 If one limits the existing knowledge to the existing data and its description with the above six rules, then u. a. the following findings are drawn. 1) To minimize the distance y, it follows from Rule 1 and 4 that Dl is to be chosen large. In order to maintain the validity of the model one chose Dl = 11. 6 AT 505 455 B1 2) Rule 5 describes a minimum distance of y5imjn = -2.6242.3.95 + 11.3787 = 1.013 and Rule 1 a maximum distance of yi, max = -0.4791 , 4.25 - 0.0144.11 + 3.1415 = 0.947. Thus, Rule 1 describes a parameter range that results in smaller distances, i. H. from rule 1 (and 2) B = 4.5 was chosen. 3) Rule 2 describes a maximum distance of y2, max = -0.9861. 4.5 - 0.0422. 11 - 0.2351. 1.5 + 6.1025 = 0.8482 and Rule 3 has a minimum distance of y3irr) in = -1.3829.4.5 - 0.053.11 -0.3434. 1.3 + 8.1813 = 0.9288. Thus, Rule 2 describes a parameter range that results in smaller distances, i. H. from rule 2, DA = 3.5 was chosen. Attention was paid to the weighting of the parameters in the linear model of Rule 2, d. H. In order to obtain approximately the same influence of all parameters, a value for DA was chosen which gives approximately the same contribution as the B and Dl. The parameter data set thus obtained is shown in line 29 of the table of FIG. A simulation (= calculated determination) with these values of the parameters leads to the values of the target values given in line 29 and a distance y = 0.345. Taking into account the partly strongly opposing influences of the six parameters and the small benefit of further iterations, this very satisfactory result was ended. As a result, the recess 7 is introduced on the side surface 5, 6 of the respective bearing shell 2 with the parameters found. In any case, a variation of the parameters found in a range of plus or minus 3% leads to significantly improved load ratios compared to conventionally formed recesses. A bearing shell that is within 25% of these values, however, also has significant improvements in durability compared to known bearing shells which have no or other formed punctures. For bearing shells with radii r the sliding surface at least in the range of 28 mm to 34 mm, the found parameters T, B, R, Dl and DA can be scaled accordingly. Thus, the parameters for bearing shells in this radius range are within 25%, preferably within 3% of the following values: T = 0.168. r B = 0.161. r R = 1.107. r Dl = 0.393. r DA = 0.125. r W = 50 °. It is also conceivable and possible, albeit with a greater outlay, to generate a dependency model in which the dependence between values of the corresponding parameters and the resulting values of the load variables or of the respective distances from the target values of the load variables is indicated.

2294,DK-2201138-T3,"GRADING, STAGE DETERMINATION AND FORECAST OF CANCER USING osteopontin-C ",2007,"DESCRIPTION FIELD [0001] This application relates to methods for grading, staging, and prognosticating cancers, such as breast cancer, for example ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and kits that can be used for such methods. BACKGROUND [0002] Around 20% of women who undergo breast biopsy procedures are diagnosed with breast cancer on the basis of conventional histological evaluation. Most biopsies are obtained with a core needle, and sampling or interpretation error may understate the disease identified. Furthermore, the early stages of breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)) are difficult to differentiate from benign growths on one end of the spectrum and invasive cancers on the other end. There is a 30-50% risk that DCIS, if not treated, will progress to breast carcinoma. Currently, there are no molecular markers at hand that identify this fraction of high risk DCIS cases. This makes it difficult to decide whether a patient should be treated with lumpectomy, lumpectomy plus radiation or hormone therapy, or resection of the entire breast. While research has identified a large number of biomolecules to be deregulated or defective in breast cancer, relatively few of them are commonly used in histological diagnosis. Specifically, markers that predict invasiveness have not been firmly established. Better molecular predictors of progression are needed to facilitate rational treatment decisions. [0003] Several markers are commonly used in breast cancer diagnosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved and ASCO-recommended tumor markers CA15.3, CA27.29, and CEAare useful only for monitoring the therapy of advanced breast cancer or its recurrence. These serum markers still lack the adequate sensitivity (below 25%) and specificity (below 70%) to be applicable in detecting early stage breast carcinoma in a large population [1,2], Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) facilitate decisions on therapy, but are weak prognostic measures [2-4], HER2 over-expression is associated with poor prognosis, but this mechanism underlies only about one third of breast cancers. [0004] Few tumor markers are under study as predictors of breast cancer progression. The transcript and protein of the polycomb group transcriptional repressor EZH2 are consistently elevated in invasive breast carcinoma compared with normal breast epithelia. The EZH2 protein levels are strongly associated with breast cancer aggressiveness [5]. VEGF correlates strongly with uPA in the node-positive population. Patients with high VEGF levels display poor outcome, with an increased risk for the node-positive subset. Furthermore, infiltrating ductal carcinomas express higher levels of both uPA and VEGF than intralobular carcinomas [6], Multiple malignant breast cancer cell lines over-express the metastasis gene osteopontin, and transfection of this gene into benign tumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines conveys invasive behavior [7], Consequently, osteopontin has been identified as a prognostic marker associated with patient survival. However, osteopontin may also be present in non-tumorous tissue and in the plasma of healthy individuals [8, 9]. [0005] Osteopontin may serve as a cytokine and as an extracellular matrix molecule. It can support migration and protect from programmed cell death after ligation of certain integrin receptors or a CD44 variant on the cell surface. The biological functions of metastasis-associated gene products are extensively regulated on the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels [10], Consistently, osteopontin secreted from various cells has diverse structural characteristics [11, 12] and tumor-derived osteopontin forms are smaller than osteopontin secreted by non-transformed cells [13], Transcripts for three osteopontin splice variants are expressed in invasive, but not in non-invasive, breast tumor cell lines [14], [0006] Alternative splicing of osteopontin occurs upstream of the central integrin binding domain and the C-terminal CD44 binding domain. Osteopontin-b lacks exon 5 and osteopontin-c lacks exon 4. SUMMARY [0007] While the acquisition of invasiveness is a critical step in early stage breast carcinomas (such as CIS), no established molecular markers reliably identify tumor progression. The metastasis gene osteopontin (OPN) is subject to alternative splicing, which yields three messages, osteopontin-a (OPN-a), osteopontin-b (OPN-b), and osteopontin-c (OPN-c). It is shown herein that OPN-c is a biomarker for breast cancer. The RNA message for OPN-c was present in 16 of 20 breast cancers (80%), but was undetectable in 22 normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty. In contrast, OPN-a RNA was expressed at various levels in all 20 breast cancers, eleven tumor-surrounding tissues, and 21 normal samples. The splice variant OPN-b was present at barely detectable levels in 18 of 20 cancers and in six of 22 normal breasts. By immunohistochemistry, 66 of 69 normal breasts were negative, while three showed low level staining. Among the breast cancers, 43 of 56 cores (77%) stained positive for OPN-c. When correlated with tumor grade, the staining for OPN-c increased from grade 1 to grade 3. OPN-c detects a higher fraction of breast cancers than estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In 178 breast specimens analyzed, OPN-c was present in 78% of cancers, 36% of surrounding tissues, and 0% of normal tissues. Therefore, OPN-c can serve as a selective diagnostic and prognostic marker for breast cancer. It can also be used in a diagnostic panel together with conventional breast cancer markers such as ER, PR and HER2. [0008] Based on these observations, methods for grading breast cancer (such as CIS) in a subject are provided. The method includes detecting or measuring OPN-c in a breast sample, wherein the presence of relatively high OPN-c levels indicates that the subject has a higher grade (e.g., a more aggressive form of) breast cancer, such as a grade 3 breast cancer. In contrast, if relatively low OPN-c levels are detected in the breast or other cancer sample, this indicates that the subject has a lower grade (e.g., a less aggressive form of) breast cancer, such as grade 1. In some examples, when referring to tumor grades herein (i.e., grade scale of 1-3) the tumor grading is as per the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson system [15 ]. However, one skilled in the art vwll appreciate that other methods can be used, and that variations in scoring may occur between samples or when different detection reagents are used. The greater the amount of OPN-c detected (e.g., 3 on a scale of 0 to 3) indicates that the subject has a higher grade (or more aggressive form of) breast cancer, such as a grade 3 cancer, while the lower the amount of OPN-c detected (e.g., 1 on a scale of 0 to 3) indicates that the subject has a lower grade (or less aggressive form of) breast cancer, such as grade 1. Any method of detecting OPN-c can be used, such as methods that permit detection of OPN-c proteins (e.g., by using OPN-c antibodies) or OPN-c nucleic acid molecules (e.g., by using OPN-c nucleic acid probes or primers). [0009] The method can further include detecting or measuring one or more other cancer markers in the sample, such as the breast cancer markers ER; PR; and/or HER2. For example, low levels of ER or high levels of HER2 and significantly elevated OPN-c (an in some examples also low PR) in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject a grade 2 or 3 breast cancer while lower levels of OPN-c and in some examples also lower levels of HER2 (and in some examples if the sample is also ER+ and/or PR+) in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a grade 1 breast cancer. [0010] Based on the results of the method, a treatment protocol can be selected for the subject. Currently, there is no particular treatment regimen for a subject who is shown to be OPN-c positive. However, based on the data provided herein, subjects shown to have a more aggressive form of breast or other cancer (for example even if they are negative for ER, PR, or HER2) can receive a more aggressive therapy (such as one or more of mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation) than subjects shown to have a less aggressive form of the cancer. [0011] In particular examples, the method has a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 80%, such as a sensitivity of at least 90% and a specificity of at least 90%. [0012] Disclosed herein are also kits that can be used for breast or other cancer diagnosis, staging, grading, or combinations thereof. For example, such kits can be used to identify a subject having aggressive or less aggressive forms of breast cancer. The ki ts can include or consist of specific binding agents (such as antibodies) that bind to one or more of ER, PR, HER2, and OPN-c. [0013] The ki ts can include or consist of nucleic acid primers or probes specific for OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2. The kits can also include one or more control samples (such as positive and negative control samples) whose detectable levels of ER, PR, HER2 and/or OPN-c and/or grade of breast cancer are known. [0014] The foregoing and other objects and features of the disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

The data are presented as mean ± SEM. The total number of samples and the number of samples with undetectable levels of osteopontin over 40 cycles of amplification is indicated above the graph. B) Representative agarose gel with the real-time RT-PCR products of a tumor specimen. C) Reproducibility of real time RT-PCR amplification. MDA-MB-435 cells, known to express OPN-a and the splice variants -b and -c [14], were used as control for calculating the expression of osteopontin forms in the tissue, β-actin served as a reference gene and relative expression ratios of the target gene were calculated from the cycle threshold and efficiency measurements (Pfaffl, Nucleic Acids Res 29:e45, 2001). Repeated thawing of cDNA degrades the messages for osteopontin splice variants faster than the message for β-actin. The breast specimens were obtained and analyzed over two time periods interrupted by a break of several months. The scatters of the reference values within each time period were tighter than the combined ranges, possibly reflecting a small influence by batch-to-batch variations in the reagents used for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification. [0016] FIGS. 2A-C: Antibody characterization. A) Specificity of anti-hOPNc IgY Hens were immunized with a peptide representing the splice junction of human OPN-c. To mimic an internal sequence, the peptide was N-terminally acetylated. At the end of the immunization period, total immunoglobulin (IgY) was purified from eggs and used for Western blotting. Left panel: supernatants from transfected MCF-7 cells probed with the anti-hOPNc antibody (a prior Western blot of the same supernatants had demonstrated the comparable expression levels of OPN-a and -c). Right panel: 400 ng of GST-OPN was loaded per lane, probed with the anti-hOPNc antibody. The additional band around 120 kD is commonly observed for osteopontin and likely reflects an aggregated form of the molecule. The purity of the GST-OPN fusion proteins is shown on the Coommassie gel. Osteopontin-a and -c were amplified by PCR by exclusion of the signal peptide (amino acids 1-17). The amplified fragments were subcloned into pGEX-5T vector and transformed into BL21 bacteria for protein synthesis. Reading frames and sequence fidelity were confirmed by sequencing analysis. The proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by pull-down with GSH-Sepharose. B) Immunocytochemistry of cell lines with known OPN expression levels. MCF-7 cells and ZR-75 cells are non-invasive and do not express osteopontin, MDA-MB-435 cells are metastatic in vivo and express all three osteopontin splice variants [14]. C) Staining of breast cancer tissue with the IgY antibody to osteopontin-c (top left) or with a rabbit antibody to a common region of all splice variants (0-17, Assay Designs Inc.) (bottom left). The negative controls (top and bottom right) reflect the work-up without the primary antibody. [0017] FIGS. 3A-C: Expression of osteopontin-c protein in breast tissue. Tissue arrays were stained by immunohistochemistry and scored by a board-certified pathologist. A) Combined pathology scores (mean intensity multiplied by mean percent of tissue stained) for the individual samples of the normal breast array (top) and the breast carcinoma array (bottom). Note that the highest positively scoring core, number 7, in the normal breast array was judged to be possibly cancerous. B) Representative images (taken at 40x magnification) of the immunohistochemical staining for OPN-c. Increasing grades are shown for intraductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and papillary adenocarcinoma. The insert depicts a normal breast tissue specimen as a reference. The slides are counterstained with Hematoxylin II and Bluing Reagent (Ventana Medical Systems Inc.). C) Pathology scores for tumors of increasing grade (left panel) or of tumors versus normal breasts (right panel). Shown are the mean cytoplasmic combined score (top row), the mean percent positive cells (middle row), and the mean cytoplasmic intensity (bottom row). The error bars represent SEM. [0018] FIGS. 4A-C: OPN-c is a more sensitive marker for breast cancer than ER, PR, or HER2. A) Pathology scores for tumors of increasing grade. Shown are the mean combined scores for ER (top), PR (middle) and HER2 (bottom). The error bars represent SEM. B) Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (SRCC) and associated confidence parameters for the correlation of breast carcinoma staining for OPN-c with the staining observed for ER, PR and HER2 by immunohistochemistry. The scatter plots show the combined mean scores for osteopontin-c versus ER, PR or HER2. C) Threshold probabilities for the best performing logistic regression model for predicting breast cancer grades 2 or 3 with a combination of OPN-c, ER, and HER2.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Abbreviations and Terms [0020] The following explanations of terms and methods are provided to better describe the present disclosure and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present disclosure. The singular forms a,” ""an,” and ""the” refer to one or more than one, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the term ""comprising an antibody"" includes single or plural antibodies and is considered equivalent to the phrase ""comprising at least one antibody."" The term ""or"" refers to a single element of stated alternative elements or a combination of two or more elements, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, ""comprises"" means ""includes."" Thus, ""comprising A or B,"" means ""including A, B, or A and B,"" without excluding additional elements. Dates of GenBank Accession Nos. referred to herein are the sequences available at least as early as October 15, 2007. [0021] Unless explained otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below. The materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. CIS: carcinoma in situ DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ ER: estrogen receptor HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 LCIS: lobular carcinoma in situ OPN: osteopontin PR: progesterone receptor [0022] Antibody: Immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, that is, molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen (such as OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2). Exemplary antibodies include monoclonal, polyclonal, and humanized antibodies. [0023] A naturally occurring antibody (such as IgG, IgM, IgD) includes four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. As used herein, the term antibody also includes recombinant antibodies produced by expression of a nucleic acid that encodes one or more antibody chains in a cell (for example see U.S. Patent No. 4,745,055; U.S. Patent No. 4,444,487; WO 88/03565; EP 256,654; EP 120,694; EP 125,023; Faoulkner et al„ Nature 298:286, 1982; Morrison, J. Immunol. 123:793, 1979; Morrison et al., Ann Rev. Immunol 2:239, 1984). [0024] The term antibody also includes an antigen binding fragment of a naturally occurring or recombinant antibody. Specific, non-limiting examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term antibody include Fab, (Fab')2, Fv, and single-chain Fv (scFv). Fab is the fragment that contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain or equivalently by genetic engineering. Fab1 is the fragment of an antibody molecule obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain; two Fab' fragments are obtained per antibody molecule. (Fab')2 is the fragment of the antibody obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction or equivalently by genetic engineering. F(Ab')2 is a dimer of two FAb' fragments held together by disulfide bonds. Fv is a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains. Single chain antibody (""SCA"") is a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule. Methods of making these fragments are routine in the art. [0025] Binding affinity: Affinity of an antibody for an antigen, such as the affinity of an antibody for an OPN-c peptide. In one example, affinity is calculated by a modification of the Scatchard method described by Frankel et al., Mol. Immunol., 16:101-106, 1979. In another example, binding affinity is measured by an antigen/antibody dissociation rate. In yet another example, a high binding affinity is measured by a competition radioimmunoassay. In several examples, a high binding affinity is at least about 1 x 10""® M. In other example, a high binding affinity is at least about 1.5 x 10""®, at least about 2.0 x 10""®, at least about 2.5 x 10""®, at least about 3.0 x 10'®, at least about 3.5 x 10""®, at least about 4.0 x 10'®, at least about 4.5 x 10""®, or at least about 5.0 x 10""® M. [0026] Breast cancer: Includes any tumor of the breast, such as tumors of epithelial (carcinoma) or stromal (sarcoma) breast tissue. Exemplary in situ epithelial breast cancers include DCIS and LCIS. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a tumor that consists of abnormal cells in the lining of a lobule. Subjects having LCIS means that the subject has an increased risk of developing breast cancer in either breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is made up of abnormal cells in the lining of a duct. It is a pre-invasive malignant tumor, and is also called intraductal carcinoma. The abnormal cells have not yet spread beyond the duct and have not yet invaded the surrounding breast tissue. DCIS is sometimes called Stage 0 breast cancer because it is not invasive. Exemplary invasive breast carcinomas include carcinoma NOS (not otherwise specified), lobular carcinoma, tubular/cribriform carcinoma, mucinous (colloid) carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and metaplastic carcinoma. An exemplary breast sarcoma is phyllodes tumour. [0027] Contact: To bring one agent into close proximity to another agent, thereby permitting the agents to interact. For example, an antibody can be applied to a microscope slide or other surface containing a biological sample, thereby permitting detection of one or more proteins in the sample that are specific for the antibody. [0028] Detect: To determine if an agent is present or absent. In some examples this can further include quantification. For example, use of an antibody specific for a particular protein (e.g., OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2) permits detection of the protein in a sample, such as a sample containing breast cancer tissue. In particular examples, an emission signal from a fluorophore (such as an increase in the signal) is detected. [0029] Detection can be in bulk, so that a macroscopic number of molecules (such as at least 1023 molecules) can be observed simultaneously. Detection can also include identification of signals from single molecules using microscopy and such techniques as total internal reflection to reduce background noise. [0030] Estrogen receptor (ER): A member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors is activated by 17β-estradiol. Estrogen receptors, such as ERa, are overexpressed in around 70% of breast cancer cases, referred to as ""ER positive"" (ER+). There are two different forms of the estrogen receptor, usually referred to as a and β, each encoded by a separate gene (ESR1 and ESR2 respectively). ERa (OMIM 133430), expressed from the ESR1 gene, is found in endometrium, breast cancer cells, ovarian stroma cells and in the hypothalamus. Therefore, in particular examples ER refers to the ERa form found in breast cancer cells. [0031] Estrogen receptor sequences are publicly available. For example, GenBank Accession Nos: BC128574.1 (nucleic acid) and P03372.2 (protein) disclose human ERa sequences and Nos. NM_007956.4 (nucleic acid) and P19785.1 (protein) disclose mouse ERa sequences. In one example, an ER sequence includes a full-length wild-type (or native) sequence, as well as variants (e.g., polymorphisms) found in breast cancer cells. In certain examples, ER has at least 80% sequence identity, for example at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98% sequence identity to a native ERa (such as the sequence of GenBank Accession Nos: P03372.2, BC128574.1, NM_007956.4 and P19785.1) and retains ERa activity (e.g., expressed in breast cancer cells). In other examples, an ER nucleic acid sequence has a sequence that hybridizes under very high stringency conditions to a sequence set forth in GenBank Accession No. BC 128574.1 or NM_007956.4 and is expressed in breast cancer cells. [0032] Grading cancer: A cancer can be graded according to its level of differentiation. The lower the number, the lower the grade, and the slower the cancer is growing. Cancers are usually graded on a scale of 1 to 3. Grade 1 indicates the cancer cells look similar to normal cells, and the cancer is likely to be less aggressive. Grade 2 indicates the cancer cells appear dysplastic, and are more likely to be aggressive and grow faster. Grade 3 cancer cells highly dysplastic and are more likely to be very aggressive in growth. [0033] Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2): A member of the ErbB protein family, which is a proto-oncogene. In humans, the HER2 gene is located at the long arm of human chromosome 17(17q11.2-q12). Approximately 25-30% of breast cancers have an amplification of the HER2/neu gene or overexpression of its protein product, referred to as ""HER2 positive” (HER2+). HER2+ patients can receive the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) as a therapy for breast cancer. Overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer has been associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. [0034] HER2 sequences are publicly available. For example, GenBank Accession Nos: NM_001005862.1 and NM 004448.2 (nucleic acid) and NP_001005862.1 and NP_004439.2 (protein) disclose human HER2 sequences. In one example, a HER2 sequence includes a full-length wild-type (or native) sequence, as well as HER2 variants (e.g., polymorphisms) found in breast cancer cells. In certain examples, HER2 has at least 80% sequence identity, for example at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98% sequence identity to a native HER2 (such as the sequence of GenBank Accession Nos: NM 001005862.1, NM_004448.2, NP_001005862.1 and NP 004439.2) and retains HER2 activity. In other examples, a HER2 nucleic acid sequence has a sequence that hybridizes under very high stringency conditions to a sequence set forth in GenBank Accession No. NM_001005862.1 or NM_004448.2 and retains HER2 activity. [0035] Label: An agent capable of detection, for example by spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, or microscopy. For example, one or more labels can be attached to an antibody, thereby permitting detection of the target protein. In another example, one or more labels can be attached to a nucleic acid probe, thereby permitting detection of the target nucleic acid molecule. Exemplary labels include radioactive isotopes, fluorophores, ligands, chemiluminescent agents, enzymes, and combinations thereof. [0036] Normal cells or tissue: Non-tumor, non-malignant cells and tissue. [0037] Nucleic acid molecules: A deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer including, without limitation, cDNA, mRNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic (such as chemically synthesized) DNA. The nucleic acid molecule can be double-stranded or single-stranded. Where single-stranded, the nucleic acid molecule can be the sense strand or the antisense strand. In addition, nucleic acid molecule can be circular or linear. The disclosure includes methods that detect OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2 nucleic acid molecules. [0038] Osteopontin-c (OPN-c): Osteopontin is a secreted multi-functional phosphorylated glycoprotein expressed at high levels in tumors, including those of the breast. Several splice variants of OPN have been identified, including OPN-a (native sequence), OPN-b (truncated sequence) and OPN-c (truncated sequence). OPN-c lacks exon 4 (27 amino acids) in the NH2-terminal region of the mature sequence. OPN-c lacks the transglutaminase reactive domain (Gly-X-Gly) which can mediate covalent homodimer cross-linking as well as heterodimer formation to other matrix components (such as fibronectin). [0039] OPN-c sequences are publicly available. For example, GenBank Accession Nos: D28761 (nucleic acid) and BAA05951 (protein) disclose human OPN-c sequences. In one example, an OPN-c sequence includes a wild-type (or native) sequence, as well as OPN-c variants (e.g., polymorphisms) expressed in breast cancer cells. In certain examples, OPN-c has at least 80% sequence identity, for example at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98% sequence identity to a native OPN-c (such as the sequence of GenBankAccession Nos: D28761 and BAA05951). In other examples, an OPN-c nucleic acid sequence has a sequence that hybridizes under very high stringency conditions to a sequence set forth in GenBankAccession No. D28761 and retains OPN-c activity. [0040] Primer: Short nucleic acid molecules, for instance DNA oligonucleotides 10 - 100 nucleotides in length, such as about 15, 20, 25, 30 or 50 nucleotides or more in length, such as this number of contiguous nucleotides of a OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleic acid molecule (e.g., gene, cDNA, or mRNA sequence). Primers can be annealed to a complementary target DNA strand by nucleic acid hybridization to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand. Primer pairs can be used for amplification of a nucleic acid sequence, such as by PCR or other nucleic acid amplification methods known in the art. [0041] Methods for preparing and using nucleic acid primers are described, for example, in Sambrook et al. (In Molecular Cloning: ALaboratory Manual, CSHL, New York, 1989 ), Ausubel et al. (ed.) (In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1998), and Innis et al. (PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA, 1990). PCR primer pairs can be derived from a known sequence, for example, by using computer programs intended for that purpose such as Primer (Version 0.5, © 1991, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA). One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the specificity of a particular primer increases with its length. [0042] In one example, a primer includes at least 15 consecutive nucleotides of an OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleic acid molecule, such as at least 18 consecutive nucleotides, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, at least 35, at least 40, at least 45, at least 50 or more consecutive nucleotides of an OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleotide sequence. Such primers can be used to amplify OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2, for example using PCR. [0043] Probe : Ashort sequence of nucleotides, such as at least 8, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 21, at least 25, or at least 30 nucleotides in length (e.g., 8 to 40 or 10 to 30 nucleotides), used to detect the presence of a complementary sequence (such as a OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleic acid sequence), for example by molecular hybridization. Ideally, a probe that is specific for a particular nucleic acid sequence (e.g., an OPN-c sequence) does not significantly hybridize to other nucleic acid sequences (e.g., non-OPN-c sequences) under highly stringent conditions. In particular examples, oligonucleotide probes include a label that permits detection of oligonucleotide probe:target sequence hybridization complexes. For example, an oligonucleotide probe can include these numbers of contiguous nucleotides of an OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleic acid molecule (e.g., gene, cDNA, or mRNAsequence), along with a detectable label. Such an oligonucleotide probe can be used to detect the presence of the OPN-c, ER, PR, or HER2 nucleic acid molecule in a sample. [0044] Progesterone receptor (PR): An intracellular steroid receptor that specifically binds progesterone. Progesterone receptors are overexpressed in some breast cancer cases, referred to as ""PR positive"" (PR+). [0045] The term progesterone receptor (OMIM: 607311) includes those progesterone receptor genes (PGR) found in mammals and retains progesterone receptor biological activity. Progesterone receptor sequences are publicly available. For example, GenBank Accession Nos: AF016381.1 (nucleic acid) and AAD01587.1 (protein) disclose human PR sequences and Nos. M68915.1 (nucleic acid) and AAA39971.1 (protein) disclose mouse PR sequences. In one example, a PR sequence includes a full-length wild-type (or native) sequence, as well as PR variants (e.g., polymorphisms) that retain PR biological function (e.g., ability to bind progesterone). In certain examples, PR has at least 80% sequence identity, for example at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98% sequence identity to a native PR (such as the sequence of GenBank Accession Nos: AF016381.1, AAD01587.1, M68915.1 and AAA39971.1) and retains PR activity. In other examples, a PR nucleic acid sequence has a sequence that hybridizes under very high stringency conditions to a sequence set forth in GenBank Accession No. AF016381.1 or M68915.1 and retains PR activity. [0046] Quantify: To express as a numerical amount, whether an actual amount or a relative amount. [0047] Sample: A biological specimen containing genomic DNA, RNA (including mRNA), protein, or combinations thereof, obtained from a subject. Examples include, but are not limited to, peripheral blood, urine, saliva, tissue biopsy, surgical specimen, and autopsy material. In some examples, the sample is a tissue sample obtained from a subject known to have, or suspected to have, cancer. In one example, a sample includes breast tissue, such as that obtained during a needle biopsy, lumpectomy, or mastectomy. Samples, such as tissue samples, can be placed on microscope slides. In particular examples, samples are used directly, or can be manipulated prior to use, for example, by fixing (e.g., using formalin) or embedding (e.g., in plastic or paraffin). [0048] Specific binding agent: An agent that binds substantially only to a defined target. Thus an OPN-c specific binding agent is an agent that binds substantially to an OPN-c peptide or nucleic acid molecule. In one example, the specific binding agent is an antibody that specifically binds an OPN-c peptide. [0049] The term ""specifically binds"" refers, with respect to an antigen such as OPN-c, to the preferential association of an antibody or other specific binding agent, in whole or part, to the antigen and not to other antigens. A certain degree of nonspecific interaction can occur between a specific binding agent and a non-target antigen. Nevertheless, specific binding can be distinguished as mediated through specific recognition of the antigen. Specific binding results in a significant association between the antibody (or other specific binding agent) and the antigen than between the antibody and a non-antigen. Specific binding typically results in greater than 2-fold, such as greater than 5-fold, greater than 10-fold, or greater than 100-fold increase in amount of bound antibody or other specific binding agent to the antigen as compared to binding to a non-specific antigen. [0050] The determination that a particular agent binds substantially only to OPN-c or other protein (e.g., ER, PR, or HER2) can be made using or adapting routine procedures. For example, western blotting can be used to determine that a specific binding agent, such as an antibody, binds substantially only to the protein (such as substantially only binds OPN-c but not to other proteins in a breast cancer cell) (for example see Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1988). A variety of immunoassay formats are appropriate for selecting antibodies or other specific binding agent specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein (such as OPN-c). For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. [0051] Staging cancer: A cancer, such as breast cancer, can be staged to describe the extent or severity of a cancer based on the extent of the original (primary) tumor and the extent of spread in the body. Staging considers the primary tumor (T), the regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). The size of the primary tumor and the extent of regional lymph node metastases are usually staged on a scale from 0 to 4. Metastases are staged as 0 (no metastases present) or 1 (metastases present). Low numbers indicate tumors that have spread little, while high numbers refer to tumors that have spread extensively. The TNM classification is most commonly used (see the AJCC Staging Manual), where T describes the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes any lymph nodes that are involved, and M describes metastasis (spread of cancer from one body part to another). However, other classification frameworks for staging cancer are within the scope of this disclosure. [0052] In particular examples, the stages of breast cancer are as follows: Stage 0 - carcinoma in situ; Stage I - Tumor (T) does not involve axillary lymph nodes (N); Stage IIA- T 2-5 cm, N negative, or T <2 cm and N positive; Stage IIB - T >5 cm, N negative, or T 2-5 cm and N positive (< 4 axillary nodes); Stage MIA - T >5 cm, N positive, or T 2-5 cm with 4 or more axillary nodes; Stage NIB - T has penetrated chest wall or skin, and may have spread to < 10 axillary N; Stage NIC - T has >10 axillary N, 1 or more supraclavicular or infraclavicular N, or internal mammary N; and Stage IV - Distant metastasis (M). [0053] Subject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes human and non-human mammals, such as veterinary subjects. In a particular example, a subject is one who had or is suspected of having had breast cancer, such as DCIS. [0054] Target molecule: A biomolecule whose detection or measurement is desired, such as a breast cancer marker. Examples of target molecules include OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER-2. [0055] Tumor: A neoplasm. In one example, a tumor is one that expresses OPN, such as OPN-c. Exemplary tumors that express OPN include but are not limited to adrenocortical cancer, ameloblastoma, ampullary cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangioma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, granular call tumor, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, hydatiform mole, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, oral cancer, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pilomatricoma, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, salivary gland tumor, soft tissue tumors, Spitz naevus, squamous cell cancer, teratoid cancer, and thyroid cancer. [0056] Under conditions sufficient for: A phrase that is used to describe any environment that permits the desired activity (e.g., appropriate time, temperature, reaction conditions). An example includes contacting an antibody or nucleic acid probe with a breast cancer sample sufficient to allow detection of one or more target molecules (e.g., ER, PR, HER2, OPN-c) in the sample and can include quantification of one or more target molecules in the sample. Methods of Grading and Staging Cancer [0057] The methods of the present invention are defined in the appended claims. [0058] It is shown herein that the OPN-c splice variant is expressed in 75-80% of breast carcinomas, but not in normal breast tissues. The levels of OPN-c correlate with tumor grade. This makes OPN-c a marker for the invasive potential of breast tumors, which can permit clinicians to select appropriate treatment regimens for a patient with breast or other cancer. OPN-c is a better breast cancer marker than OPN-a because it is absent from normal breast tissue. In fact, quantitative analysis of the RNA levels did not discern statistically significant differences between normal and tumorous breasts for OPN-a. Based on these results, detection of OPN-c in a tumor sample can be used to grade or stage any OPN-expressing tumor, such as adrenocortical cancer, ameloblastoma, ampullary cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangioma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, granular call tumor, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, hydatiform mole, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, oral cancer, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pilomatricoma, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, salivary gland tumor, soft tissue tumors, Spitz naevus, squamous cell cancer, teratoid cancer, and thyroid cancer. [0059] The lack of reliable molecular indicators for breast cancer progression has led to efforts to use increasingly complex readouts. Multiple tumor markers, including HER2 amplification/over-expression, cathepsin D, and uPAR, have been considered for prognostication and therapy decisions of breast cancer in a Tumor Marker Utility Grading System (Hayes et al., Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 52:305-19, 1998). A gene prognosis profile of 70 genes, developed at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, has been characterized as a good predictor of outcome (van de Vijver et al., N. Engl. J Med. 347:1999-2009, 2002). The likelihood of distant recurrence in breast cancer patients, who have estrogen receptor positive tumors and no involved lymph nodes, can be defined with a panel of 21 gene products, amplified by RT-PCR from paraffin blocks, and correlated with the likelihood of distant recurrence (Paik et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 351:2817-2826, 2004). The selective expression of OPN-c in breast cancers, but not in healthy breasts, can provide a simpler and comparably reliable diagnostic and prognostic marker. [0060] The disclosed methods and kits can provide additional treatment options. For example, if a subject is positive for ER, PR or HER2, there are standard treatment regimens (e.g., Herceptin for HER2+ or tamoxifen for ER+ or PR+). However, for subjects that are negative for all three of ER, PR and HER2, there is no current method to determine how these subjects will progress. It is shown herein that at least 38% of subjects who are negative for ER, PR and HER2 are highly positive for OPN-c, and the OPN-c highly positive subjects are those having more aggressive cancers (e.g., grade 2 and 3). Therefore, the disclosure provides methods of selecting patients having breast or other cancers that are highly OPN-c positive for additional, more aggressive therapies (such as a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy or a lumpectomy combined with chemotherapy (such as Herceptin® therapy if the tumor overexpresses HER2 and tamoxifen or other anti-estrogen therapy if the tumor overexpresses ER) instead of a lumpectomy alone). [0061] Provided herein are methods of grading an OPN-expressing breast cancer, for example DCIS or LCIS. In some examples, the cancer is a breast cancer is known to be ER- (ER negative), PR-, and HER2-. The method can include detecting or measuring the OPN-c expression level in a breast cance sample obtained from the subject, wherein the presence of significant amounts of detectable OPN-c in the breast cancer sample (e.g., top 1/3 intensity or top 2/3 intensity) indicates that the subject has more aggressive cancer (such as a higher grade, such as grade 2 or 3 breast cancer), the presence of moderate amounts of detectable OPN-c (e.g., mid-1/3 intensity) in the breast sample indicates that the subject has a moderately aggressive cancer (such as a grade 2 breast cancer), while the presence of lower amounts of detectable OPN-c (e.g., lower 1/3 intensity) in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a less aggressive cancer (such as a lower grade, such as grade 1 breast cancer). In some examples, the method further includes selecting a subject having or suspected of having breast or other cancer that expresses OPN (such as OPN-c). [0062] In some examples, the level of OPN-c expression is quantified or scaled, and may optionally be compared to a control or reference value (or range of values) of OPN-c expression (such as a positive or negative cancer control, or a particular grade of tumor). Quantification does not require determining an absolute amount, but can include determining a relative amount. For example, the relative or absolute quantity of OPN-c in a sample can be determined. In some examples, the relative amount of OPN-c present is determined, for example by quantifying the amount of OPN-c present. In some examples, OPN-c expression levels are normalized, for example normalized by comparing OPN-c expression to a control (e.g., the level of expression of a housekeeping gene such as β-actin or GAPDH) in the tumor sample. In some examples, OPN-c (and in some examples other cancer markers or housekeeping genes known in the art) is also detected or measured in normal tissue, or in non-cancerous tissue adjacent to cancer tissue. For example, normal breast tissue can serve as a negative or background control for OPN-c, as OPN-c is not expressed in normal breast tissue (see FIG. 1A). [0063] In one example, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to detect OPN-c (and other cancer markers). In some examples when IHC is used, the scale of detectable staining is represented on a typical 1+ to 3+ scale to represent the intensity, wherein 0 is assigned to negative staining, 3 being assigned to very intensely staining samples, and 1 assigned to weakly staining samples (see Table 1). In some examples a value of 2 is re-tested. Therefore, in particular examples, if a level of ""1"" is detected for OPN-c, this indicates that the subject has a less aggressive cancer (such as a grade 1 breast cancer or a stage 0-1 breast cancer), while detection of a level ”3” for OPN-c indicates that the subject has an aggressive cancer (such as a grade 2 or 3 breast cancer or a stage II or higher breast cancer). For example, as shown in Table 1, tumors can be graded depending on their relative level of OPN-c expression. One skilled in the art will appreciate that these values are not absolutes and can vary depending on the samples and reagents used. Table 1: Exemplary correlation of OPN-c staining intensity to tumor qrade. [0064] The methods of the present disclosure are not limited to particular methods of representing OPN-c expression levels present in the subject sample. Although the typical 1+ to 3+ scale to represent the signal intensity can be used (for example when IHC is used to detect a target molecule), other scales can be used. In one example, the mean combined score is used to represent the OPN-c levels present in a subject sample. The mean combined score methods can provide a scale ranging from 0 to 300. The tissues are assessed by scoring the cytoplasm using a typical 1+ to 3+ scale to represent the intensity, with 3 being assigned to very intensely staining samples, 1 to weakly staining samples, and 0 to negatively staining samples. Combined pathology scores are calculated from mean intensity (ranging from 1 to 3) multiplied by mean percent (ranging from 0 to 100) of tissue stained. The highest possible score is 300. To assign a tumor grade, the modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) system may be used, which considers nuclear grade, tubule formation, and mitotic rate. The combination of scores for these factors is applied to assign a grade of 1, 2, or 3 (or to assign a particular tumor stage). In some examples, the signal (or value in the range of 0 to 300) obtained from the sample tissue is compared to a control signal (or value or range of values expected from a control sample). For example, the resulting value from the experimental sample in the range of 0 to 300 can be compared to control samples having known tumor grades (or normal tissue) and their resulting values on the 0 to 300 sale, or can be compared to expected values on the 0 to 300 scale for each tumor grade (or stage). For example if a control grade 3 tumor has a range of 250 to 300, control grade 2 tumor has a range of 150 to 249, control grade 1 tumor has a range of 50 to 149, and the normal sample has a range of 0 to 49, if the experimental value obtained is 275 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 3 tumor while if the experimental value obtained is 74 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 1 tumor. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the values provided above are for demonstration purposes, and that absolute values or ranges of values will vary, for example depending on the method used to detect expression. [0065] Yet other methods that can be used to represent the OPN-c levels present in a subject sample include a continua of numbers, whose absolute value may vary depending on the particular experimental sample and/or the particular control (e.g., particular housekeeping gene) used. Examples of such methods are known in the art (see for example US Patent Nos. 7,056,674 and 7,081,340; herein incorporated by reference). For example, if nucleic acid detection methods are used, for example real time RT-PCR, OPN-c and a control (e.g., a housekeeping gene) are detected in the experimental sample. Using this information, OPN-c expression can be normalized against the expression level of a housekeeping transcript, for example by generating a ratio of OPN-c expression to control expression. The normalization can be used to correct for differences in the amount of RNA assayed and variability in the quality of the RNA used. In some examples, the method also includes detecting expression of a normalizing gene, such as a housekeeping gene. Alternatively, normalization can be based on the mean or median signal of all of the assayed genes or a large subset thereof (global normalization approach). On a gene-by-gene basis, measured normalized amount of a patient tumor mRNA can be compared to the amount found in a breast cancer tissue reference set. The number of breast cancer tissues in this reference set should be sufficiently high to ensure that different reference sets (as a whole) behave essentially the same way. Typically, the breast cancer tissue reference set consists of at least about 30 different breast cancer tissue specimens. The level measured in a particular tumor sample to be analyzed falls at some percentile within this range, which can be determined by methods well known in the art. [0066] The higher the OPN-c:housekeeping gene expression level ratio for a particular housekeeping gene, the higher the grade of cancer in the experimental sample (e.g., grade 3), while a lower OPN-c:housekeeping gene expression level ratio for a particular housekeeping gene indicates a lower grade of cancer. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the absolute ratio for a particular OPN-c:housekeeping gene and the corresponding grade (or stage) of tumor, may vary. For example, if a control grade 3 tumor has a OPN-c^-actin ratio of greater than 3,000, control grade 2 tumor has a OPN-c:β-actin ratio of 500 to 2,999, control grade 1 tumor has a OPN-c^-actin ratio of 50 to 499, and the normal sample has a OPN-c:β-actin ratio of less than 50, if the experimental OPN-c:p-actin ratio obtained is 9,000 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 3 tumor while if the experimental OPN-c:β-actin ratio obtained is 1,000 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 1 tumor. On the other hand, if a different housekeeping gene is used, such as GAPDH, the range of values may differ. For example, For example, if a control grade 3 tumor has a OPN-c:GAPDFI ratio greater than 10,000, control grade 2 tumor has a OPN-c:GAPDH ratio of 1000 to 9,999, control grade 1 tumor has a OPN-c:GAPDH ratio of 999 to 100, and the normal sample has a OPN-c:GAPDH ratio of less than 100, if the experimental OPN-c:GAPDH ratio obtained is 60,000 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 3 tumor while if the experimental OPN-c:GAPDH ratio obtained is 500 the experimental sample is concluded to be a grade 1 tumor. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the values provided are for demonstration purposes, and that absolute values or ranges of values will vary, for example depending on the method used to detect expression and the particular housekeeping gene detected. [0067] The method can further include detecting or measuring other cancer markers in the cancer sample. For example, if the sample is a breast cancer marker, the method can include detecting or measuring one or more of estrogen receptor (ER); progesterone receptor (PR); and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In some examples, ER, PR and FIER2 are detected. In some examples, the read-out for ER and PR is simply positive or negative, and the read-out for HER2 is on a scale as described above for OPN-c (e.g., see Table 1). In some examples, the absence of ER (ER-) and PR (PR-)and the presence of OPN-c and HER2 in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a more aggressive breast cancer (e.g., grade 2 or 3 breast cancer), while the presence of ER (ER+), PR (PR+), and lower HER2 (e.g., 0 or 1), and OPN-c (e.g., 1) in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a less aggressive form of breast cancer (e.g., grade 1 breast cancer). In some examples, the presence of significant HER2 (e.g., 3 on a scale of 0 to 3) and OPN-c (e.g., 3 on a scale of 0 to 3) in the breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a more aggressive breast cancer (e.g., grade 2 or 3 breast cancer). To assess the predictive value of several biomarkers in combination (e.g., OPN-c, ER, PR and HER2), a logistic regression modeling approach can be used, which assesses among several models the one that performs best. For the best performing model, a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve can be generated as a graphical plot of sensitivity/specificity as the discrimination threshold is varied. [0068] The OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2 molecules (as well as housekeeping genes and other cancer markers) can be detected by detecting proteins or nucleic acid molecules. For example, antibodies can be used to detect OPN-c, ER, PR, and FIER2 proteins, and nucleic acid probes or primers can be used to detect OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2 nucleic acid molecules. Methods of such detection are routine, and include immunohistological methods, Western blotting, and flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, as well as PCR and nucleic acid arrays. In some examples, the antibody or nucleic acid probe/primer includes a detectable label, such as a fluorophore, to permit detection of the antibody. In some examples, the antibody is detected with an appropriately labeled secondary antibody. [0069] In some examples, detection of both OPN-c protein and OPN-c nucleic acid molecules in one or more biological samples obtained from the subject (such as a breast cancer tissue sample) are used to grade or stage a tumor that overexpresses OPN-c (such as DCIS). [0070] In some examples, the method further includes selecting a treatment protocol for the subject based on the OPN-c detection. For example, if the cancer sample is highly positive for OPN-c (and in some examples negative for ER, PR, and HER2), a more aggressive therapeutic protocol can be selected as this indicates the subject has a more aggressive form of cancer (e.g., grade 3). Exemplary more aggressive therapies include a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy, a lumpectomy combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy (e.g., anti-HER2, anti-ER, and/or anti-PR therapies for example Trastuzumab (Herceptin®), bevacizumab (Avastin®), pertuzumab (OmniTarg™), ZM105180 (Zemab®), ertumaxomab (Rexonum), Arimide>® and tamoxifen) instead of lumpectomy alone, or an increase in the dose and/or number of courses of chemotherapy. Methods of administering such therapies are routine in the art and can be designed by skilled clinicians. In contrast, if the cancer sample has lower amounts of OPN-c (and in some examples negative for ER, PR, and HER2), a less aggressive therapeutic protocol can be selected, as this indicates the subject has a less aggressive form of cancer (e.g., grade 1). Exemplary less aggressive therapies include a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy, a lumpectomy alone instead of a lumpectomy combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, or a decrease in the dose and/or number of courses of chemotherapy. Methods of administering such therapies are routine in the art and can be designed by skilled clinicians. [0071] In some examples, the diagnostic antibodies for ER, PR, HER-2 are obtained from Ventana Medical Systems (Tuscon, AZ). However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other antibodies that can be used in the methods provided herein are commercially available from other sources, such as: Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), Santa Cruz biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). In some examples, the OPN-c antibody is the one described in Example 1. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other OPN-c antibodies that can be used in the methods and kits provided herein are commercially available from other sources, such as Gallus Immunotech, Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Biological samples [0072] Exemplary samples include, without limitation, blood smears, cytocentrifuge preparations, cytology smears, core biopsies, fine-needle aspirates, and/or tissue sections (e.g., cryostat tissue sections and/or paraffin-embedded tissue sections). Methods of obtaining a biological sample from a subject are known in the art. For example, methods of obtaining breast tissue or breast cells are routine. Exemplary biological samples may be isolated from normal cells or tissues, or from neoplastic cells or tissues. Neoplasia is a biological condition in which one or more cells have undergone characteristic anaplasia with loss of differentiation, increased rate of growth, invasion of surrounding tissue, and which cells may be capable of metastasis. Exemplary neoplastic cells or tissues may be isolated from solid tumors, including breast carcinomas (e.g. lobular and duct carcinomas), adrenocortical cancer, ameloblastoma, ampullary cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, cervical cancer, cholangioma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, granular call tumor, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, hydatiform mole, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, oral cancer, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pilomatricoma, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, salivary gland tumor, soft tissue tumors, Spitz naevus, squamous cell cancer, teratoid cancer, and thyroid cancer. [0073] For example, a sample from a tumor that contains cellular material can be obtained by surgical excision of all or part of the tumor, by collecting a fine needle aspirate from the tumor, as well as other methods known in the art. If desired, the sample can be concentrated or purified before use. For example, proteins or nucleic acids can be isolated from the sample. Such methods are routine in the art. Alternatively, the sample can be used directly. In particular examples, a tissue or cell sample is applied to a substrate and analyzed to determine if it contains detectable levels of OPN-c (and in some examples also ER, PR, and HER2). A solid support useful in a disclosed method need only bear the biological sample and, optionally, but advantageously, permit the convenient detection of components (e.g., proteins and/or nucleic acid sequences) in the sample. Exemplary supports include microscope slides (e.g., glass microscope slides or plastic microscope slides), coverslips (e.g., glass coverslips or plastic coverslips), tissue culture dishes, multi-well plates, membranes (e.g., nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) or BIACORE™ chips. In particular examples, a breast cancer sample obtained from the subject is analyzed to determine if it contains detectable levels of OPN-c mRNA or protein. [0074] Fixatives for mounted cell and tissue preparations are well known in the art and include, without limitation, 95% alcoholic Bouin's fixative; 95% alcohol fixative; B5 fixative, Bouin's fixative, formalin fixative, Karnovsky's fixative (glutaraldehyde), Hartman's fixative, Hollande's fixative, Orth's solution (dichromate fixative), and Zenker's fixative (see, e.g., Carson, Histotechology: A Self-Instructional Text, Chicago:ASCP Press, 1997). Detection of peptides [0075] In particular examples, a sample obtained from the subject is analyzed to determine if it contains detectable levels of OPN-c protein. In some examples, the sample is a breast cancer sample. The sample, for example a breast cancer sample, can also be analyzed for the presence of ER, PR, and HER2 proteins. [0076] Methods of detecting proteins are routine. In some examples, immunoassays are used to detect the presence of OPN-c protein in the sample (and in some examples additionally one or more of ER, PR, and HER2 protein). Generally, immunoassays include the use of one or more specific binding agents (such as antibodies) that can substantially only bind to the target peptide, such as OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2. Such binding agents can include a detectable label (such as a radiolabel, fluorophore or enzyme), that permits detection of the binding to the protein. Exemplary immunoassays that can be used include, but are not limited to: Western blotting, ELISA, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. A particular immunoassay is immunohistochemistry. [0077] In one example, the specific binding agent is an antibody, such as a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody, or fragment thereof. In some examples, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In some examples, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. If desired, the antibody can include a detectable label to permit detection and in some cases quantification of the target protein/antibody complex [0078] The presence of detectable signal above background or control levels indicates that the presence of a target peptide (e.g., OPN-c and in some examples additionally one or more of ER, PR, and HER2 protein) in the sample. For example, the level of OPN-c detected can be compared to a control or reference value (or range of values), such as a value that represents a level of OPN-c protein expected if a breast cancer is a grade 3, a value that represents a level of OPN-c protein expected if a breast cancer is a grade 2, a value that represents a level of OPN-c protein expected if a breast cancer is a grade 1, a value that represents a level of OPN-c protein expected if no breast cancer is present (normal tissue), or combinations thereof. Similar reference values can be used for ER, PR, and HER2 proteins. In some examples, the control is a normal (e.g., non-tumor) sample (or value expected for a normal sample). [0079] In some examples, detection of higher levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a grade 3 tumor, detection of intermediate levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a grade 2 tumor, while detection of lower levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a grade 1 tumor. In some examples, detection of higher levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a more aggressive tumor (such as stage III or above), detection of intermediate levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a moderately aggressive tumor (such as a stage II tumor), while detection of lower levels of OPN-c indicates that that subject has a less aggressive tumor (such as a stage I or less). The amount of OPN-c detected can depend on the measurement used (e.g., see FIG. 3C). Detection of OPN-c or other cancer marker (e.g., PR, ER, HER2) can be represented as the mean cytoplasmic combined score, mean percent positive, or mean percent intensity, or other value known in the art. The value obtained for the test cancer sample can be compared to a reference value (or range of values), such as a reference value representing a value or range of values expected for grade 1, 2, or 3 breast cancer (or a particular stage of cancer). In some examples, the reference is a sample possessing a known or expected amount of OPN-c protein. For example, cell lines MCF-7 and ZR-75 are negative for OPN-c, while MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 are positive for OPN-c (all cell lines available from American Type Culture Collection). In some examples, the sample is one having a known grade 1, 2, or 3 breast cancer and a particular value or range of values for OPN-c (and in some examples also values for ER, PR, and HER2). The test value for OPN-c (and in some examples also test values for ER, PR, and HER2) can be compared to the reference value, to correlate the value to a grade of cancer. For example, if the level of OPN-c detected in the subject's sample is similar or greater than the level of OPN-c in a known grade 3 breast cancer sample or falls in the range expected for a grade 3 breast cancer, this indicates that the subject has a grade 3 breast cancer. Detection of nucleic acid molecules [0080] In particular examples, a sample obtained from the subject is analyzed to determine if it contains detectable levels of OPN-c nucleic acid molecules (and in some examples also ER, PR, and HER2), such as a breast cancer sample, a sample adjacent to the tumor, normal breast tissue, or combinations thereof. In particular examples, OPN-c (and in some examples also ER, PR, and HER2) nucleic acid molecules (such as mRNA or cDNA) are measured. [0081] Methods of detecting nucleic acid molecules are routine. In particular examples, a breast cancer sample obtained from the subject is analyzed to detect OPN-c nucleic acid molecules (and in some examples also ER, PR, and HER2 nucleic acid molecules), such as cDNAor mRNA. For example, assays that permit detection of nucleic acids can be used. Exemplary assays that can be used include, but are not limited to: Northern blotting, Southern blotting, PCR (such as RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR), and DNA arrays. For example, OPN-c can be amplified from a sample using PCR, and the OPN-c amplicons detected and in some examples quantified. [0082] In some examples, detection of higher levels of OPN-c cDNA or mRNA indicates that that subject has a grade 3 tumor, detection of intermediate levels of OPN-c cDNAor mRNA indicates that that subject has a grade 2 tumor, while detection of lower levels of OPN-c cDNAor mRNA indicates that that subject has a grade 1 tumor. In some examples, detection of higher levels of OPN-c cDNA or mRNA indicates that that subject has a more aggressive tumor (such as stage III or above), detection of intermediate levels of OPN-c cDNA or mRNA indicates that that subject has a moderately aggressive tumor (such as a stage II tumor), while detection of lower levels of OPN-c cDNAor mRNA indicates that that subject has a less aggressive tumor (such as a stage I or less). The amount of OPN-c cDNA or mRNA detected can depend on the measurement used. [0083] In one example, a nucleic acid probe that hybridizes to an OPN-c nucleic acid is contacted with the breast or other cancer cancer sample. For example, the probe can be incubated with the sample under high stringency conditions (such as when the hybridization is performed at about 42°C in a hybridization solution containing 25 mM KPO4 (pH 7.4), 5X SSC, 5X Denhart's solution, 50 pg/mL denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 10% Dextran sulfate, and 1-15 ng/mL probe (about 5x107 cpm/pg), while the washes are performed at about 65°C with a wash solution containing 0.2X SSC and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), wherein the presence of higher amounts of signal indicates that the breast cancer is a grade 3 cancer and the presence of lower amounts of signal indicates that the breast cancer is a grade 1 cancer. [0084] Real-time RT-PCR reactions can be performed using routine methods in the art. For example, a SYBR Green detection format can be used with optimized concentrations of template, primers, and MgCl2- For each test sample, a no-template reaction can be included as a negative control. The reaction conditions can include 35-40 cycles of melting, a primer set specific annealing temperature, extension, and melting curve program, and finally a cooling step. Product purity, product size, and absence of primer dimers can be confirmed by DNA melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The threshold value for amplification can compared to a housekeeping gene and to a reference sample. The relative abundance of the RNA message is then calculated by methods known to the skilled artisan (see e.g., Pfaffl Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 ;29:e45, herein incorporated by reference as to the method). [0085] The value obtained (or signal detected) for the test breast cancer sample can be compared to a reference value, such as a reference value representing a value or range of values expected for grade 1, 2, or 3 breast cancer (or a particular stage of cancer). In some examples, the reference is a sample possessing a known or expected amount of OPN-c nucleic acid molecule. For example, cell lines MCF-7 and ZR-75 are negative for OPN-c, while MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 are positive for OPN-c (all cell lines available from American Type Culture Collection). In some examples, the sample is one having a known grade 1,2, or 3 breast cancer and a particular value or range of values for OPN-c nucleic acid molecules (and in some examples also values for ER, PR, and HER2). The test value for OPN-c (and in some examples also test values for ER, PR, and HER2) can be compared to the reference value, to correlate the value to a grade of cancer. For example, if the level of OPN-c nucleic acid molecule detected in the subject's sample is similar or greater than the level of OPN-c nucleic acid molecule in a known grade 3 breast cancer sample or falls in the range expected for a grade 3 breast cancer, this indicates that the subject has a grade 3 breast cancer. Methods of Prognosing Cancer [0086] Methods are disclosed herein for prognosing a cancer by examining OPN-c levels in a tumor sample obtained from a subject. OPN-c can be detected as described above, wherein the presence of significant amounts of detectable OPN-c in the cancer sample (e.g., top 1/3 intensity or top 2/3 intensity) indicates that the subject has a worse prognosis while the presence of lower amounts of detectable OPN-c (e.g., lower 1/3 intensity) in the cancer sample indicates that the subject has a better prognosis. Detection of OPN-c in a tumor sample can be used to prognose any OPN-expressing tumor, such as adrenocortical cancer, ameloblastoma, ampullary cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangioma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, granular call tumor, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, hydatiform mole, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, oral cancer, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pilomatricoma, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, salivary gland tumor, soft tissue tumors, Spitz naevus, squamous cell cancer, teratoid cancer, and thyroid cancer. [0087] Prognostic methods can be used to predict likely tumor progression, survival time, likely worsening of the condition, and the like, for example the prognosis in the absence of therapy (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy). For example, the methods can be used to determine whether a tumor may be less aggressive (e.g., less rapidly growing, and/or less likely to metastasize) or more aggressive (e.g., rapidly growing, and/or more likely to metastasize), for example independent of therapy. A less-aggressive tumor can be characterized by any parameters known in the art, including, for instance, decreased growth rate (e.g., increased rate of apoptosis and/or decreased rate of cell division), decreased rate of metastasis, and/or increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. A more aggressive tumor can be characterized by any parameters known in the art, including, for instance, increased growth rate (e.g., decreased rate of apoptosis and/or increased rate of cell division), increased rate of metastasis, and/or decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy. In some examples, prognosis for a subject can be characterized by actual survival after initial diagnosis (such as 6-month survival, 1-year survival, 2-year survival, or 5-year survival), and/or actual survival relative to the average survival for similarly situated patients. A better prognosis entails, e.g., survival of a patient for more than 1 year after initial diagnosis (such as more than 2 years or more than 5 years), or survival of a patient for more than 6 months longer (e.g., more than 1 year longer, more than 2 years longer, more than 5 years longer) than the average survival for similarly situated. A worse prognosis entails, e.g., survival of a patient for less than 5 years after initial diagnosis (such as less than 2 years or less than 1 years), or survival of patient less than the average survival for similarly situated patients (such as, about 3 months less than average survive, about 6 months less than average survive, or about 1 year less than average survival). [0088] As described above, in some examples, the amount of OPN-c is quantified or scaled, wherein higher levels of OPN-c indicate a more aggressive cancer and a worse prognosis, and lower levels of OPN-c indicate a less aggressive cancer and better prognosis. For example, if the typical 1+ to 3+ scale is to represent the intensity as described above, if a level of ""1"" is detected for OPN-c, this indicates that the subject has a less aggressive cancer (e.g., decreased likelihood of death within 5 years of diagnosis or decreased likelihood of metastasis), while detection of a level ""3"" for OPN-c indicates that the subject has an aggressive cancer (e.g., increased likelihood of death within 5 years of diagnosis or increased likelihood of metastasis). In other examples, the mean combined score method is used as described above (where scores range from 0 to 300). For example, the resulting value from the experimental sample in the range of 0 to 300 can be compared to control samples having known prognosis and values on the 0 to 300 sale, or can be compared to expected values on the 0 to 300 scale for each prognosis. For example if a control poor prognosis (e.g., 5 year survival rate of less than 5%) has a range of 250 to 300, and a control good prognosis (e.g., 5 year survival rate of greater than 95%) has a range of 0 to 49, if the experimental value obtained is 275 the experimental sample is concluded to have a poor prognosis while if the experimental value obtained is 20 the experimental sample is concluded to have a good prognosis. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the values provided above are for demonstration purposes, and that absolute values or ranges of values will vary, for example depending on the method used to detect expression. [0089] In other examples, OPN-c nucleic acid levels present in a subject sample are normalized as described above (see for example US Patent Nos. 7,056,674 and 7,081,340). In particular examples, the higher the ratio for a particular housekeeping gene, the worse the prognosis, while a lower ratio for a particular housekeeping gene indicates a better prognosis. Kits [0090] Disclosed herein are kits that can be used to grade, stage, and prognose a breast or other OPN-expressing cancer, for example to determine if a cancer is more or less aggressive, determine the likelihood that a cancer will metastasize, and predicting the survival time of a subject with cancer. Generally cancer grading is performed on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being less aggressive and 3 being the most aggressive. [0091] In particular examples, the kit includes or consists of an antibody that specifically binds estrogen receptor (ER); an antibody that specifically binds progesterone receptor (PR); an antibody that specifically binds HER2; and an antibody that specifically binds OPN-c. In some examples, the kit does not include a PR antibody. In some examples, the kit includes or consists of a nucleic acid probe or primer specific for an ER nucleic acid sequence; a nucleic acid probe or primer specific for a PR nucleic acid sequence; nucleic acid probe or primer specific for a HER2 nucleic acid sequence 2; and nucleic acid probe or primer specific for an OPN-c nucleic acid sequence. In particular examples, the kit does not include a PR nucleic acid probe or primer. In some examples, the antibody or nucleic acid probe or primer is labeled (for example, with a fluorescent, radioactive, or an enzymatic label). [0092] In some embodiments, the antibodies, probes, or primers are provided suspended in an aqueous solution or as a freeze-dried or lyophilized powder, for instance. The container(s) in winich the antibodies, probes, or primers are supplied can be any conventional container that is capable of holding the supplied form, for instance, microfuge tubes, ampoules, or bottles. The amount of antibodies, probes, or primers supplied can be any appropriate amount, such as from about 1 to about 5 pg/ml. [0093] In other embodiments, control slides upon which are mounted one or more tissue or cell preparations (e.g., xenografts, cell pellets, or clotted cells) that may serve as positive and/or negative controls for OPN-c, ER, PR, and/or HER2 expression may be provided in an appropriate and separate container. [0094] The kits can include antibodies or nucleic acid molecules specific for one or more housekeeping molecules, such as one or more of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase), HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1), HBS 1 L (HBS1-like protein), β-actin, and AHSP (alpha haemoglobin stabilizing protein). [0095] The kit can also include one or more control samples, such as positive or negative control samples. For example, a controls sample can be a normal breast or breast cancer sample with known relative amounts of ER, PR, HER2 and OPN-c. In a particular example, the control sample is a xenograft control. [0096] One skilled in the art will appreciate that the kits can include other agents to facilitate the particular application for which the kit is designed. For example, the kit can additionally contain means of detecting a label (such as enzyme substrates for enzymatic labels, filter sets to detect fluorescent labels, appropriate secondary labels such as a secondary antibody, or the like), as well as buffers and other reagents routinely used for the practice of a particular diagnostic method. Example 1 Materials and Methods [0097] This example describes the materials and methods used to obtain the results described in Examples 2-5. Although particular exemplary methods and materials are described, one skilled in the art will appreciate that variations can be made. For example, different antibodies can be used. [0098] Human breast cancer RNA: Specimens of human breast tumors, non-transformed surrounding tissue, as well as healthy breast tissue (obtained from reduction mammoplasties) were provided by the tissue procurement facility of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center/Children's Fbspital. Samples were obtained from 20 invasive ductal carcinomas at grades ll-lll. The average patient age was 55 years, ranging from 35 to 84 years. The tumor stages ranged from T1 to T4 and from NO to N4, the status of metastases was unknown in all cases. Eleven samples of tumor-surrounding tissue came from patients with the mean age of 61 years, ranging from 46 to 84 years. Normal tissues were obtained from 22 reduction mammoplasties. The patient age ranged from 21 to 57, with an average of 36.5 years. Total RNA was extracted from specimens using TRIZOLR Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a total volume of 20 μΙ. [0099] PCR Amplification: All PCR reactions were performed on a Cepheid (Sunnyvale, CA) Smart Cycler using SYBR Green detection format. 0.5 μΙ of cDNA was added to each PCR reaction in a total volume of 25 μΙ using the standard Invitrogen PCR buffer system with optimized concentrations of MgCl2· For each experiment a no-template reaction was included as a negative control. The conditions for PCR were 94°C denaturation for 120 s followed by 35-40 cycles of: 94°C melting for 15 s, a primer set specific annealing temperature (Table 2), extension at 72°C and melting curve program (60-95°C with a heating rate of 0.2°C per second and a continuous fluorescence measurement), and finally a cooling step to 4°C. Product purity, product size, and absence of primer dimers were confirmed by DNA melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Melt curves yielded a single sharp peak for all template reactions, and a minimal melt peak (resulting from primer dimers) or no melt peaks for the notemplate control reactions. Table 2: Primer pairs for real-time RT-PCR. [0100] For conventional RT-PCR, the osteopontin splice variants were amplified with specific primer pairs [14]. The amplification of GAPDH with primers 5-TGAAGGT CGGAGT CAACGGATTT GGT-3' (forward; SEQ ID NO: 13) and 5'- CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3' (reverse; SEQ ID NO: 14) served as a control for equal loading and integrity of the cDNA. All PCR products were analyzed by Tris-acetate EDTA agarose (2.5% w/v) gel electrophoresis. [0101] Immunohistochemistry: A normal breast multi-array (Cybrdi, Fredrick, MD) containing 69 normal cores (plus three infiltrating ductal carcinomas as references) and a breast carcinoma multi-array containing 56 cancer cores confirmed by the examining pathologist (7 cores were diagnosed not to contain carcinoma and were therefore excluded), were stained for OPN-c. The carcinoma array included intraductal carcinomas, infiltrating ductal carcinomas, infiltrating lobular carcinomas, papillary adenocarcinomas, mucinous adenocarcinomas, and Paget's disease. [0102] The immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted on the automated Discovery™ or Benchmark™ staining platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Antigen retrieval for osteopontin-c was not required. The slides were incubated with an affinity-purified anti-OPN-c chicken IgY (produced by Gallus Immunotech), at 1:160 dilution for 32 minutes at room temperature. The secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted to 1:80 in Ventana Antibody diluent (devoid of casein and azide), was applied for 16 minutes at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using the ChromoMap™ DAB detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems). Rabbit monoclonal antibodies to human estrogen receptor (ER, clone SP1), progesterone receptor (PR, clone 1E2), and to HER2 (clone 4B5) from VMSI were also used to stain the breast carcinoma array, and were detected using the UltraView™ DAB kit (VMSI). The primary antibody was applied for 16 minutes at 37°C and the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied for 8 minutes at 37°C. All slides were counterstained with Hematoxylin II (VMSI) for 8 minutes followed by Bluing Reagent (VMSI) for 4 minutes at room temperature. [0103] The tissue arrays were assessed by a board-certified pathologist. The cytoplasm was scored using a typical 1+ to 3+ scale to represent the intensity, with 3 being assigned to very intensely staining samples, 1 to weakly staining samples, and 0 to negatively staining samples. Combined pathology scores were calculated from mean intensity (ranging from 1 to 3) multiplied by mean percent (ranging from 0 to 100) of tissue stained for the individual samples of the breast arrays. The highest possible score is 300. To assign a tumor grade, the modified Searff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) system [15] was used, which considers nuclear grade, tubule formation, and mitotic rate. The combination of scores for these factors was applied to assign a grade of 1, 2, or 3. [0104] DNA constructs and transfection: The constructs for expression of the human osteopontin splice variants were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from the malignant breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-435. The coding sequence of osteopontin was amplified with the primers 5'-CAAACG CCG ACC AAG GGAAAAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 15) and 5'-CTT CTT TCT CAG TTT ATT GGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 16). The amplified product was TA cloned, excised with Xhol and Nhel, and was subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA). Genes cloned into this vector are expressed under the control of the CMV promoter. Sequence fidelity and accurate reading frame were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. MCF-7 cells were transfected by the Fugene method and stable clones were selected in G418. [0105] Immunoblot assay: For the analysis of secreted osteopontin, serum-free cell culture supernatant was collected from each transfectant. 40 μΙ of supernatant per sample were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels with nonreducing sample buffer. For the analysis of intracellular osteopontin, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCI, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Nadeoxycholate, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate). Cell lysates at equal amounts of protein (20 pg/lane) were electrophoresed on reducing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with antibody 0-17 (Assay Designs Inc.) to osteopontin. Example 2 Osteopontin-c RNAis expressed in breast cancer but not in normal breast tissue [0106] This example describes results of measuring osteopontin gene expression in breast cancer specimens, tumorsurrounding tissues, and normal samples by real-time RT-PCR using splice variant specific primers and the amplification of β-actin as a control for abundance. [0107] Because breasts contain various amounts of fat and the source of osteopontin are selectively the epithelial cells, the levels of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19, epithelial marker) and aP2 (adipocyte marker) were measured and the results adjusted to account for the fraction of epithelial cells. As shown in Figures 1Aand 1B, OPN-c was detected in 16 of 20 tumors and the RNA levels had a relative abundance comparable to the full length form osteopontin-a. In contrast, there was no detectable OPN-c in any of the normal tissues examined. Seven of eleven tumor-surrounding normal tissues were devoid of OPN-c. It is not known whether the four normal specimens that showed OPN-c expression had cryptic tumor cell infiltration or a reaction to the tumor, such as inflammation. All four were grade 3 tumors without Paget disease, but their tumor stages varied. [0108] The expression levels of OPN-a varied in 21 specimens of normal breasts, with only four samples lacking detectable levels (FIGS. 1Aand 1B). This may reflect the production of unspliced osteopontin, which is physiologically secreted in milk, by breast cells depending on the stages of the estrous cycle. The splice variant OPN-b was present at low levels in 18 of 20 cancers, in eight of eleven tumor surrounding tissues, and in six of 22 normal breasts (FIGS. 1Aand 1B). [0109] Statistical evaluations were performed on the data from the real time RT-PCR measurements. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks, the levels of osteopontin-c in the tumors are different (p<0.05) from the levels of OPN-c in the normal samples. The tumor-surrounding tissues have intermediate values and are not different from either the tumors or the normal samples. Analogous results were obtained for OPN-b. For osteopontin-a, no differences were detected among the three groups of samples. The proportion of positives for OPN-c RNA were compared among the groups by the chi-square test (χ2=13.33, p<0.001), and the proportion of positives differed between normal breasts and breast cancers (p<0.0007 by Fisher's exact test), while it was not significantly different between tumors and surrounding normal tissues (p=0.16 by Fisher's exact test). [0110] Every PCR run included a negative control without a template and a known cDNA reference sample as a positive control. For the osteopontin splice variants and β-actin, the positive control was the MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cell line that produces large amounts of RNA for all three osteopontin forms. The positive control for CK-19 was the breast tumor cell line MCF-7, while a fatty breast specimen provided the reference for aP2. OPN-a and β-actin levels were highly reproducible in these samples. The range encountered for the other amplicons also indicated good reproducibility, but was wider. The exact quantification of low abundance RNA messages is inherently more subject to fluctuations than higher abundance messages (FIG. 1C). In sum, with the inclusion of suitable controls, the accuracy of these measurements vull allow diagnostic or prognostic decisions to be based on them. Example 3 The levels of OPN-c correlate with tumor grade in histology [0111] An IgY antibody was raised to the splice junction of OPN-c. The antibody selectively recognized OPN-c, but not OPN-a on Western blots (FIG. 2A). In a solid-phase ELISA, the antibody reacted strongly with GST-OPNc, but only weakly with GST-OPNa, whereas the pan-osteopontin antibody 0-17 (Assay Designs Inc.) showed very strong reactivity with both GST-OPN forms. [0112] Immunocytochemistry was performed on cell lines with previously confirmed distinct osteopontin expression levels [14]. Consistently, strong cytoplasmic staining was seen in MDA-MB-435 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells or ZR-75 cells (FIG. 2B). Staining of breast cancer tissue with the anti-hOPNc antibody was compared to the anti-pan-osteopontin antibody 0-17. The cancer was strongly positive for total osteopontin and for OPN-c. In the absence of the respective primary antibodies, no staining was observed (FIG. 2C). [0113] The generated OPN-C antibody was used to analyze breast tissue arrays by immunohistochemistry. As shown in FIG. 3A, three of 69 normal breasts had low positive staining, while all the others were negative. Among the breast carcinomas, 43 of 56 cores (77%) stained positive for OPN-c while 13 tissue samples were negative. When analyzed for its correlation with tumor grade, OPN-c staining increased from grade 1 to grade 3 (FIG. 3B), regardless of whether mean intensity, mean percent positive, or the mean cytoplasmic combined score was used as a mode of assessment (FIG. 3C). Example 4 OPN-c is a more sensitive marker for breast cancer than ER, PR, or HER2 [0114] The growth factor receptors estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 may be up-regulated in breast cancer and are used in diagnosis to facilitate therapy decisions. Therefore OPN-c expression was compared to these markers. [0115] Of the 56 cores, 28 were positive and 28 were negative for ER, 19 were positive and 37 were negative for PR, and there were 14 HER2 positive and 42 HER2 negative cores. Tumors with high expression of HER2 were low or negative for ER and PR. Conversely, ER and PR staining were high in breast cancer specimens with low or absent HER2. Whereas increasing tumor grade was associated with an increase in positivity for OPN-c staining according to mean combined score, mean percent positive, and mean intensity (compare FIGS. 3B and 3C), ER and PR were substantially reduced in higher grade tumors. HER2 was slightly higher in grades 2 and 3 than in grade 1 (FIG. 4A). [0116] To determine whether the cytoplasmic OPN-c staining of breast carcinomas was correlated with the membrane staining of HER2 or the nuclear staining of ER and PR, the mean combined scores were compared according to Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) [16], There was no significant correlation between OPN-c and any of these three breast markers. Only a tentative correlation according to SRCC was found with HER2 (FIG. 4B). As a metastasis gene, OPN-c is a marker for different characteristics of breast cancer than these growth factor receptors. [0117] It was then determined whether OPN-c has diagnostic value in conjunction with ER, PR and HER2. Applying a logistic regression modeling approach [17, 18], OPN-c was the best single predictor of a grade 3 cancer (ROC score 0.809; ROC score for ER 0.575, for PR 0.570, for HER2 0.551). Furthermore, the combination of OPN-c, ER and HER2 can diagnose grade 2-3 tumors with high reliability (ROC score 0.979) (FIG. 4C). In this model, high OPN-c and HER2 scores correspond to a higher likelihood of grade 2-3, and higher ER corresponds to a lower probability of grade 2-3. PR had poor predictive value. [0118] Triple-negative breast cancer (missing ER, PR, and HER2) lacks the benefit of a specific therapy and is associated with a difficult risk assessment [19], For all grades of breast cancer, 14% of the tissue cores that were positive for OPN-c were not stained by ER, PR, or HER2. Selectively for the highest grade of cancer (grade 3), approximately 35% of the cases that were stained by anti-OPN-c were negative for all of the 3 other breast cancer markers tested (Table 3). Hence, OPN-c detects a larger fraction of breast cancers than do ER, PR or HER2. It can therefore indicate transformation in cases where the other three markers fail. Table 3: Histochemical staining for OPN-c, ER, PR, and HER2. [0119] The comparison of percentages of samples staining positively for osteopontin-c versus all three growth factor receptors in breast carcinoma tissue array cores indicates that OPN-c is a more sensitive marker. It also detects a fraction of triple negative breast cancers. Note that samples with one or two of the receptors staining positively have been omitted for clarity. Example 5 OPN-c expression in other cancers [0120] Beside breast cancer, osteopontin has been associated with the progression of other malignancies, including colon cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and glioblastoma. A limited number of colon tumors (n=6), their surrounding tissues (n=4), and colitis specimens (n=3) were obtained and expression levels of osteopontin splice variants analyzed using realtime RT-PCR. [0121] While the sample numbers are still small, they indicate that a proportion of colorectal carcinomas produce spliced osteopontin (Table 4). In fact, while OPN-a was very low in the tumors (m=0.024, range 0-0.088) and moderate in the adjacent tissues (m=0.258, range 0-0.543), the RNA message for OPN-c was expressed at very high levels in the tumors (m=0.474, range 0-1.5) and at moderate levels in the adjacent tissues (m=0.255, range 0-1.020). In the colitis samples, the expression of OPN-a was low, while OPN-b and OPN-c were barely detectable. [0122] In contrast to breast tissues, where normal specimens are accessible from reduction mammoplasties, this type of source is not available for colon. The comparison to colitis samples is somewhat compromised because several cell types of the immune system can produce osteopontin, although physiologic splicing of the osteopontin message has not yet been described. These results indicate that OPN-c is a marker of invasiveness not only for breast cancers, but also for other malignancies. Therefore, the methods and kits provided herein can be used not only for breast cancers, but other cancers as well (e.g., those that express OPN such as adrenocortical cancer, ameloblastoma, ampullary cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, cholangioma, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, granular call tumor, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular cancer, hydatiform mole, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, oral cancer, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pilomatricoma, prostate cancer, renal cell cancer, salivary gland tumor, soft tissue tumors, Spitz naevus, squamous cell cancer, teratoid cancer, and thyroid cancer). OPN-c can be evaluated in such tissues using the methods provided herein. Table 4: Osteopontin expression in other samples. Example 6 Analysis of subjects with known clinical outcome [0123] Clinical samples from subjects with breast cancer (such as DCIS) who have a known clinical outcome (for example, but not limited to, alive or dead after 1, 3, or 5 years; relapsed or relapse-free after 1, 3, or 5 years; suffering metastases or metastasis-free after a given time frame) are analyzed for the presence of OPN-c as described in Example 1. The skilled artisan will recognize that clinical outcomes can be defined in multiple ways. [0124] The clinical samples will be staged and graded as described in Example 1. The presence of OPN-c will be detected using antibodies as described in Example 1 (e.g., staining scored using a typical 1+ to 3+ scale or a 0 to 300 scale). In some examples, the clinical samples are also analyzed for ER, PR, and HER2 expression as described in Example 1. The ability of OPN-c staining of the breast cancer samples to predict the outcome of the patient will be determined. It is expected that subjects having greater OPN-c expression (e.g., 3 on a 1+ to 3+ scale) will have a greater likelihood of adverse outcome (e.g., dead after 1, 3, or 5 years of diagnosis), as compared to subjects having less or no OPN-c expression (e.g., 0 or 1 on a 1+ to 3+ scale). Subjects having less OPN-c expression (e.g., 1 on a 1+ to 3+ scale) will have a greater likelihood of a favorable outcome (e.g., alive after 1,3, or 5 years of diagnosis). Example 7 Grading of Breast Cancer in Humans [0125] This example describes particular methods that can be used to grade breast cancer, such as DCIS, in a human subject. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that similar methods can be used, and that other cancer samples (e.g., from the colon or other tissue listed in Example 5) can be used in place of breast cancer samples. In some examples, such grading is performed before treating the subject. [0126] Breast cancer cell or tissue samples are obtained from the subject. For example, a sample can be obtained from a tissue biopsy or needle aspirate using routine methods. In some examples, if a tissue biopsy sample is used, 1-100 pg of tissue can be obtained, for example using a fine needle aspirate. In particular examples, samples are used directly, or can be manipulated prior to use, for example, by fixing (e.g., using formalin) or embedding (e.g., in plastic or paraffin). In some examples, RNAor proteins are isolated from the tissue using routine methods (for example using a commercial kit). [0127] In one example, OPN-c protein levels are determined in a breast cancer sample obtained from the subject. The breast cancer sample, such as a tissue or cell sample present on a substrate (such as a microscope slide) is incubated with an OPN-c antibody in an appropriate buffer for a time sufficient for the antibody to bind to OPN-c in the sample. The OPN-c/antibody complexes are detected, for example using microscopy. In some examples, the breast cancer sample (or other sample from the same subject) is analyzed for ER, PR, or HER2 protein levels using appropriate antibodies. [0128] The antibody/protein complexes can be detected by a label on the antibody, or with a secondary labeled antibody. The resulting stained array slides can be scored by light microscopy by a pathologist according to the following criteria: [0129] The resulting score can be used to grade, stage, or prognose the tumor (e.g., see Table 1). [0130] In other examples, the relative amount of OPN-c (or ER, PR, HER2)/antibody complexes in the breast cancer sample from the subject can be compared to a reference value, such as a relative amount of OPN-c (or ER, PR, HER2)/antibody complexes present in a normal breast sample or a breast cancer sample from a subject having a known grade of tumor (e.g., grade 1, 2 or 3). The presence of significantly greater OPN-c/antibody complexes in the test breast cancer sample relative to the control indicates that the subject has a higher grade or stage cancer (e.g., grade 3) and a worse prognosis, while the presence of less OPN-c/antibody complexes indicates that the subject has a lower grade or stage cancer (e.g., grade 1) and a better prognosis. [0131] In one example, OPN-c mRNA expression levels are determined in a breast cancer sample obtained from the subject. cDNA is generated from the RNA isolated from the breast cancer sample (for example using a commercial reverse transcription kit). OPN-c cDNA is amplified using appropriate primers (for example using primers having a detectable label), and the resulting OPN-c amplicons detected. The relative amount of OPN-c amplicons in the breast cancer sample can be normalized (e.g., to a housekeeping gene) and compared to a reference value, such as a relative amount of OPN-c amplicons present in a normal breast sample or a breast cancer sample from a subject having a known grade or stage of tumor (e.g., grade 1, 2 or 3). The presence of higher amounts of OPN-c amplicons in the test breast cancer sample indicates that the subject has a higher grade or stage cancer (e.g., grade 3) and a worse prognosis, while the presence of less OPN-c amplicons indicates that the subject has a lower grade or stage cancer (e.g., grade 1) and a better prognosis.
