",2005,"REMOTE CONTROL, DEVICE CONTROL SYSTEM AND REMOTE CONTROL METHOD References to Related Applications The present document relates to a subject related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2005-159552 filed with the Japanese Patent Office on March 31, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. 10 Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a remote control which is suitable for preferably applying, for example, an operating signal to the operation of electronic devices, such as a television receiver and the like, a device operating system that makes it possible to transmit a signal between the remote control and the electronic devices and a remote control method. 2. Description of the related state of the art In the past, a remote control based on infrared wireless transmission of control signals has been used to remotely control video devices such as a television receiver and audio devices. When operating tuning a television receiver or the like by using a remote control, a user selects and presses any of the numeric keys provided on the remote control. Through this operation, a remote control signal allocated to each of the keys is transmitted, carrying it from the 1031921 2 remote control to the television receiver for infrared radiation. The television receiver has tuning positions that have been previously set therein and that correspond to the remote control signals, and which causes switching between broadcast channels based on the infrared signal received from the remote control, to complete the tuning operation. Also known is a system that has electronic devices such as a television receiver and an audiovisual amplifier (AV amplifier) that is provided with a number of input terminals, and external devices such as different recording devices, playback devices, tuners and the like connected to the input terminals. in order to enable a single remote control to operate different devices remotely. The remote control used in this system can bring about not only the switching of the television receiver or the audiovisual amplifier, but also of any externally connected device. To switch the devices to be operated, the user must begin with the input switching operation on the television receiver side. For an exemplary television receiver in which four input terminals are provided from a first input terminal to a fourth input terminal, a preliminary correlation is made such that the first input terminal is for a DVD recording device (DVD, digital versatile disc, versatile digital disc), second clip for a video tape recorder is and so on. The connected external devices are selected by switching the input from the television receiver. This type of remote control is provided with operating switch buttons for selecting devices to be operated such as the television receiver, DVD recording device, audio-visual amplifier and so on. The user is enabled to operate target devices after switching the input from the television receiver and operating any of the control switch buttons on the remote control so that the state of the remote control changes. An assumption is now made of a case where a user who has been watching an analog basic wave broadcast wishes to change the operation to play a DVD on a DVD recording device. The user first performs a switching operation to release input from the DVD recording device connected to the television receiver. The DVD recording device is then selected by the operation switch button on the remote control. A remote control signal corresponding to the DVD operation is then transmitted from the remote control to the television receiver using infrared radiation. The user is thus enabled to perform operations for registering, displaying, stopping and the like of the DVD recording device. The publication of the Japanese patent application (KOKAI) Hei 5-236366 describes a technique for executing, from a remote control, control codes for peripheral equipment connected to a television receiver. 25 Summary of the invention For the case where an operation for selecting any device connected to a television receiver, audio-visual amplifier, etc., is done, it is otherwise necessary to operate the remote control in a state adapted for the connected device in order to adjust device settings between the television receiver and remote control. The user must therefore switch the device at any time that the input switching is done, which causes great inconvenience. A remote control is also known on which function keys are arranged side by side and which correspond to the individual devices to enable input switching and at the same time changing the state of the television receiver and the remote control. Such a remote control, however, requires a large number of function keys which are provided thereon and which correspond to the devices to be connected, so that an excessive amount of space is occupied by the operating keys. Another operation that is already being put into practice is such that a menu is displayed on a screen of the television receiver using a GUI (graphical user interface, graphical user interface) or the like, in order to enable input switching typically by operating of a pointer provided on the remote control. However, the input set on the television receiver and the state set on the remote control are not automatically correlated, so that the user cannot operate any device corresponding to an input unless the input switching is done on the television receiver, and unless a state is reset on the remote control. The present invention has been devised after considering the situation described above, and makes it possible that in a case where a number of electronic devices have to be operated remotely for easy switching between the individual electronic devices. 5 In the case where a remote control signal corresponding to each of a plurality of control target devices can be sent by the state switching, and one specific device from the plurality of control target devices can select a signal from the other control target devices, and the selection can be controlled remotely, the present invention configured such that upon receipt of a connected device signal sent from the specific device based on the selection, after operation of the input selection key provided as one type of key from a plurality of keys, for routing of the selection on the specific device, the state switching is accomplished on the basis of the received connected device signal, thereby selecting a remote-controlled operating target device by means of the remote control signal; and to display information about the selected control target device. In this configuration, a selection operation is performed on the remote control that selects an input from a specific operating target device, and a remote control signal resulting from the operation is transmitted, thereby allowing an input selection operation to continue on the specific operating target device. A connected device signal from the device connected to the input switched by the selection operation is then returned, and in accordance with an assessment made on such a returned signal, a processing of switching of the operating target device is continued which can be controlled remotely via the remote control in any type of device that has been assessed in the above. The event that the remote control target device is switched is also displayed. In the event that the operating target device which is operable via the remote control is required, the operating target device is automatically switched on the remote control in accordance with the present invention by performing an operation for switching the input of a specific target device, and this achieves an effect of improving the ease of operation.

Description of the embodiments The paragraphs below will describe an embodiment of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. This embodiment relates to the present invention which is applied to a remote control and a device control system, which is configured to remotely control a television receiver by sending a predetermined control signal to the television receiver by means of key operation by a user by means of infrared radiation, and receiving an infrared signal from the television receiver by the remote control, thereby allowing setting of the state switching on the remote control. First, an exemplary configuration of the device operating system of the embodiment will be explained with reference to Fig. 1. A television receiver 2 converts signals into a broadcast wave that is received by an antenna (not shown) to thereby receive a television broadcast program. Provided are a DVD recording device 4 suitable for recording and reproducing using an optical disc as a recording medium that conforms to the DVD standard, and a video tape recording device 5 suitable for recording and reproducing using a video tape which is placed externally as peripheral equipment. The devices are connected via cables respectively to a first input terminal 30 and a second input terminal 31 which 8 are provided on the television receiver 2, with which it is possible to provide video and audio playback signals thereby. The entire system thus configured by connecting the DVD recording device 4 and the video tape recording device 5 to the television receiver 2, which is operable by a remote control 1, is referred to as device operating system 100. The television receiver 2 is provided with a liquid crystal display 29, and audio-output speakers 26 placed on both sides of the display 29 to enable reproduction of video and audio data provided by television broadcast, the DVD recording device 4 and the video tape recording device 5. The television receiver 2 is also provided with an operating portion 33 which allows operations such as tuning, volume adjustment and so on. The remote control 1 enables the user to remotely control the television receiver 2 and can also remotely control the DVD recording device 4 and the video tape recording device 5 by state switching. Devices to be operated by remote control 1 are referred to as operating target devices. The remote control 1 has an operating section 11 in which 25 different keys are provided, and a display 14 provided with a liquid crystal display that makes it possible to display a state to be operated thereon. Also provided is a light emitting element 15a that emits infrared signals, and a light receiving element 12a 30 for receiving the infrared signals. An external example configuration and an internal example configuration of the remote control 1, and details of the processing will be accurately described later. 9 The DVD recording device 4 and the video tape recording device 5 are respectively provided with receiver portions 41, 51 which receive the infrared signals transmitted from the remote control 15. On the remote control 1, an up-button ll and a down-button llm (Fig. 2) are provided for the control switch used for switching the control target device in response to a switch input. The user switches the operating target device 10 to be operated by selecting the up key ll or the down key llm for operation switching. For example, by pressing the up button ll for operation switching on the remote control 1 to indicate ""DVD"", the user can remotely control the DVD recording device 4 by means of the remote control 1. A receiver portion 35 is also provided on the television receiver 2 which receives infrared signals transmitted from the remote control 1. It is therefore made possible to control the channel and the volume of the television receiver, by indicating ""TV"" by using the up key lik or the down key 11m for operating switching on the remote control 1. The television receiver 2 of this embodiment is further provided with a transmitting portion 36 which sends the infrared signals 25 to the remote control 1. The infrared signals transmitted by the television receiver 2 are received by the light receiving element 12a provided in a receiving section 12 of the remote control 1. Details of the processing which based on transmitting the infrared signals will be described later. Next, an external exemplary configuration of the remote control 1 of the present embodiment 10 will be described with reference to Figure 2. The remote control 1 suitable for remotely controlling electronic devices such as a television receiver comprises the light receiving element 15a which is composed of an LED (light emitting diode) which outputs the infrared signals and the light receiving element 12a which receives the infrared signals. A display 14 is also placed which is composed of a liquid crystal display, which makes it possible to display 10 characters thereon such as ""TV"", ""DVD"", ""AMP"" and the like. The remote control 1 has a control section that comprises various control keys. The operating part 11 is provided with the operating circuit 15 up-button l1 and the down-button 11m which switch between operating target devices on the remote control. The operating section 11 is also provided with an on / off button 11a which switches a power source of the operating target device on / off by operating the up button lik and the down button 11m. Figure 2 shows an exemplary state in which the display 14 indicates ""DVD"" and the remote control 1 is set to an operating state for the DVD recording device. Details of the condition will be described later. The remote control 1 has numbers from ""1"" to ""12"" printed on it and is provided with number keys 11b as direct channel selection keys that allow the user to press them to effect a channel selection. The channel selection position can be indicated by sending a remote control signal of a code allocated to each of the number keys 11b to the television receiver 2. When the operating condition of the device is set to a device other than the 11 television receiver, they function as the keys for indicating the channel selection position of the thus set device. The channel selection keys provided herein are a channel up key 11c and a channel down key member, wherein the channel selection position is increased by the channel up key 11c and lowered by the channel down key member. A volume up key 11e and a volume down key 11f are provided similarly to volume adjustment keys, wherein the volume is increased by the volume up key 11e and lowered by the volume down key 11f. An input switching key lig is an input selection key by means of which the input of the television receiver 2 is selected. The input selection key lig is a toggle selection switch that makes it possible to switch step by step with each operation. Inputs from the television receiver 2 can be switched using the input switch key in accordance with a loop of ""INPUT 1"", ""INPUT 2"", ... and so on. A directional key 11h is also provided which indicates the up, down, left and right directions, and an input key 11i, which enable operations to display a menu of functions, content, etc. on the screen 29 of the television receiver 2, for moving the pointer, and for selecting and confirming necessary components. Control keys are also provided which enable operations for ""REVERSE"", ""PLAY"", ""FAST FORWARD"", ""REGISTER"", ""PAUSE"", ""STOP"" for the DVD recording device and the video tape recording device 5 , which are activated when the state of the remote control is set to ""DVD"" and ""VTR"", respectively. 12 The following paragraphs will explain an internal exemplary configuration of the remote control 1 of this embodiment, with reference to a block diagram shown in Figure 3. Upon operation of any of the keys in the control section 11, the control is detected by a participating micro-computer in the internal control of the remote control 1. A memory 19 temporarily stores data in which a rewritable random access memory (random access memory, RAM) is typically used. Also stored in the memory 19 are control programs, parameters, codes corresponding to the control keys, typically using a read-only memory (read-only memory, ROM) which makes it possible to read only therefrom. The microcomputer 17 provides as a control remote control signals of codes corresponding to the detection of the key operation at a transmitting portion 15. The transmitting portion 15 modulates the provided remote control signals to adjust them for transmitting, and offers the thus modulated transmitting signals to the light emitting element 15a in the transmitting portion 15 to light it up therewith. The remote control signals are thus transmitted from the transmitting portion 15. On the other hand, the infrared signal is subjected to photoelectric conversion by the light receiving element 12a such as a photo transistor, photo detector or the like, which is provided in the receiving portion 12, and is processed for reception by the receiving section 12. Signals received by the receiving section 12 include a status signal transmitted by the television receiver 2. The status signal is a signal indicating the device connected to the input terminal provided on the television receiver 2. The signal received by the receiving portion 12 is presented to the microcomputer 17. The microcomputer 17 sets an operating state of the device 5 (operating target device) indicated by the state signal if it is judged that the state signal has been received after the remote control The signal is sent by pressing the input switch key lig. In accordance with the operating state that has been set, the operating target device, which can be operated remotely by the remote control 1, is switched. In other words, even if the same key is operated, the resulting output of the remote control signal can operate different devices. It should be noted, however, that part of the keys for operating the television receiver 2 (for example, the volume up key 11e, which volume down key 11f, input switching key lie, etc.) are always used to remotely operate the television receiver 2, independent of the operating condition. Upon completion of the setting state, information (the name of the operating target device thereof) about the switched device is displayed on display screen 14, such as ""TV"", ""DVD"" or the like. The display is effected on the basis of the stored data in the memory 19. The following paragraphs will describe an internal exemplary configuration of the television receiver 2 of this embodiment, with reference to the block diagram shown in Figure 4. The case shown herein is such that a liquid crystal display is used as the display. The television receiver 2 receives broadcast waves based on, for example, the NTSC system (NTSC, National Television Standards Committee) using an antenna 21, and selects a desired broadcasting station using a tuner 22. Video / audio signals selected by the tuner 22 are provided to a switching portion 23 that forms part of the input circuit. The television receiver 2 of this embodiment has 2 input terminals other than the tuner 22, thereby enabling the provision of video / audio signals from external devices connected to the television receiver 2 via either a first input terminal 30 or a second input terminal 31. When the input from the television receiver 2 is viewed by the user, it is switched to select either the outputs from the first input terminal 30, the second input terminal 31, or from the tuner 22. When audio playback is required, audio signals provided by the switching portion 23 are processed by an audio processing device 24, amplified by an audio amplifier 25 and transmitted from two speakers 26. When video display is required, video signals provided from the switch portion 25 are processed by a video processing device 27 and presented to a display controller 28. The display controller 28 is composed of a liquid crystal controller or the like, and generates operating signals that match with the liquid crystal pixels in accordance with the video signals. The video / audio signals from the externally placed DVD recording device 4 and the video tape player 5 are provided to television receiver 2 while being connected by the first input terminal 30 and the second input terminal 31, respectively. A controller 32 configured by an arithmetic circuit such as a microprocessor unit (micro-processing unit, MPU) controls the processing of the television receiver 2 and manages a memory 38 that stores programs, parameters, and so on. Switching through the switching portion 23 is also controlled by the controller 32. The memory 38 is typically a rewritable RAM, and the connected devices corresponding to the inputs are managed based on the table below: input device connected; input 1 DVD recording device 4; input 2 video tape recorder 5. In the table, a correlation table of the connected devices is typically prepared by key input by the user in accordance with a GUI display on the television receiver, and is retrieved by the remote control 1. The memory 38 can be user control immediately therefor save, or broadcast images. The television receiver 2 has at the front the operating part 33 which is provided with various operating keys. The front is also provided with the receiver portion 35 which receives infrared signals provided by the remote control 1, through which the received infrared signals are demodulated, provided to the controller 32, and processed. The television receiver 2 of this embodiment 30 has a function for wirelessly transmitting as a infrared signal to remote control 1 the state signal which is an information signal concerning the devices connected to the input terminals. More specifically, when the switching was accomplished by the input switching switch portion 23, the controller 32 judges the device connected to the input terminal thus connected based on the table in the memory 38 and provides the state signal, which information is the information thus assessed. devices, to the transmitting portion 36. The transmitting portion 38 transmits the state signal thus provided as an infrared signal. The following paragraphs will describe an exemplary switching operation of the operating state of the remote control 1 in accordance with the present invention, with reference to the flow chart shown in Figure 5. The flow chart in Figure 5 shows the processing in the remote control 1 on the right and the processing in the television receiver 2 on the left. The television receiver 2 is assumed to be viewed herein. When the microcomputer 17 first judges that the input switching key h1 of the remote control 1 has been operated (step ST1), a remote control signal is sent (step ST2) which directs the corresponding input switching. When the control 32 of the television receiver 2 judges the reception of the remote control signal (step ST11), the control 32 selects the input of the television receiver 2 to have the indicated state (step ST12). The control 32 of the television receiver 2 then generates a state signal indicating the external device connected to the input terminal thus connected, and makes it possible for the transmitting portion 36 to transmit the state signal 30 therefrom (step ST13). The microcomputer 17 of the remote control 1 judges whether the state signal has been received or not (step ST3), and performs error processing if it has not received the 17 state signal even if a certain amount of time has elapsed after sending the remote control signal in step ST2 ( step ST4). Error processing is typically done in order to display the error on the screen 14 by means of characters or the like. If the microcomputer 17 judges that the status signal has been received in step ST3, then the microcomputer 17 sets an operating state therewith to enable remote operation of the external device indicated by the status signal thus received (step ST5). The remote control 1 can deliver codes for different devices that may be connected, by holding them by means of preset values or by learning. The error display can also be such that the characters are blinking. An example switching between the devices by means of a GUI menu will be explained with reference to figure 6. In figure 6 the GUI menu is shown on the screen 29 of the television receiver 2. The GUI menu enables tuning operation and the like, in addition to the input switch. A menu M1 shows that CS broadcast is tuned, and a menu M2 shows a menu that makes it possible to switch the switching of the external inputs. The user first selects the external input switching menu in the M2 menu. The selection operation can be accomplished by operating the directional key 11h and the input key 11i to move a pointer C1 up or down and left or right. For the case where the television receiver 30 is provided with first and second inputs as the external inputs, the first terminal is set to ""DVD (DVD recording apparatus 4)"" and the second input is set to ""VTR (video tape recording) device 5) "". When 18 the electronic devices to be operated is the DVD recording device 4, the user moves the pointer C1 using the directional key 11h, and determines the input 1 (DVD) by operating the input key 11i. In this case, the remote control signal is sent from the remote control 1 to the television receiver 2. Television receiver 2 switches its input state to the first input, and transmits the status signal corresponding to the first input to the remote control 1. The remote control 1 receives the status signal, and switches its own state to ""DVD"" and allows the display 14 to display ""DVD"". The user is now able to operate the DVD recording device 4. When the state of the remote control 1 is switched to ""TV"", and any tuning operation of broadcasting station channels is performed again, or any input switching operation for selecting another device is performed, a corresponding status signal is output from the main unit, and the remote control 1 receives it to switch the state. For the case where any electronic device is newly connected, the remote control 1 is additionally set with the device corresponding to the input to thereby enable operation of the electronic device. In this way it is made possible to switch the input of the receiver 2 and at the same time also switch the state of the remote control 1. Because the input switching on the television receiver 2 in this case automatically results in the state switching of the remote control 1, it is no longer necessary for the user to switch the state on the remote control 1 every 19 times when the input is switched, whereby a simple operation is achieved. Since the input switching on the television receiver 2 and the state switching on the remote control 1 are connected, it is no longer necessary to provide control keys for all directly connected electronic devices (e.g. direct keys for ""DVD"", ""TV"", ""amplifier"") and this causes a reduction in user error. It is also made possible to deal flexibly with various peripheral devices and to switch them in a simple manner. It is also still made possible to prevent radio interference by making a difference in output timing, transmission time, or oscillation frequency or the like between the remote control signal transmitted by the remote control 1 and the state signal transmitted by the television receiver 2. The memory in the embodiment described above was recorded in the remote control 1, 20 while similar effects can be obtained by using other storage media. For example, it is also possible to store the settings of the remote control beforehand in a memory card to be detached, and makes it possible for other remote controls to read the memory card connected thereto, in order to make the work of making the settings again save. The table described in the above embodiment, which makes a correlation between the inputs and the set states to be stored in the memory of the remote control 1, was such that the first input was correlated with the DVD recording device 4 and the second input to the video tape recorder 5, while the setting is in no way limited to these settings, thereby enabling various other connections such as connecting the video tape recorder 5 to the first input. It is also possible to provide a plurality of inputs, and to make the respective settings for the required devices to be connected. The correlation table settings in the above-described embodiment were made by means of the GUI menu, while the correlation table can also be set by correlating the input and the devices to be operated to the display 14 of the remote control 1. The input switching operation on the television receiver 2 in the embodiment described above was accomplished by pressing the input switching button located on the remote control 1, while it is also possible to display an input switching menu on the screen 29 and to select the input by using of the directional key llh and the input key lli. It is also still possible to provide input keys such as ""INPUT 1"", ""INPUT 2"", ... and so on on the remote control 1, thereby enabling the user to press the input keys to switch the input. The remote control 1 or the television receiver 2 can be provided with an external input terminal to enable a connection to an external network and to load various data via a network. Because various electronic devices have been newly proposed in recent years, loading 30 programs, data, etc. via the network can make the connection adaptive even with regard to the most recent electronic devices, and the display 14 can be set to 21 on it show the name of the devices to be operated. In the embodiment described above, the remote control was adapted to the device control system in which the various peripherals were connected to the television receiver, while the remote control could be configured as the one for a control system in which a compact disc player (CD player), a tuner, etc., are connected 10 are with an amplifier configured to process the audio signals that are switched between the devices. It is also still possible to connect peripheral devices such as a printer and a storage for a computer, so that only a single remote control can control these peripherals together (en bloc). In the embodiment described above, the present invention was applied to a remote control capable of wirelessly transmitting and receiving infrared signals, while the present invention can also be applied to wireless radio frequency signals based on other signal systems. The present invention is also applicable to a remote control that is wired via a communication cable. In the embodiment described above, the state switching was shown on the display 14 which was connected to the control switching up key lik and down key 11m in order to enable the user to make an assessment while the remote control 1 may be equipped with illuminated keys which ""TV"", ""DVD"", ""VTR"", ""AMP"" and the like. An external exemplary configuration of a remote control implemented with such illuminated keys will be explained with reference to Figure 7. In Figure 7, all components corresponding to those shown in Figure 2 and already described above will be given the same reference numbers. State switching keys 11 to 11q for switching the state are provided, which are executed with a self-illuminating function with which they enable themselves to light up for a predetermined period of time with the aid of built-in LEDs, when the state 10 was switched to any of the electronic devices indicated by the characters printed on these keys ll through llq. The state switch button 11 on which ""TV"" is printed corresponds to the tuner 22, the state switch button 11 on which ""DVD"" is printed corresponds to the DVD recording device 4 connected to the first input terminal 29, and the state switch button lip on which ""VTR"" is printed corresponds to the video tape recorder 5 connected to the second input terminal 30. The state switch key on which ""AMP"" is printed corresponds to an audio-visual amplifier connected to another input terminal not shown. When the user presses the state switch button 11 ""VTR 1"", the input from the television receiver 2 is set to ""the first input terminal"" to enable video / audio signals from the DVD recording device 4 to be provided. The status switch button 11a with ""DVD"" is currently on. Because the self-highlighting key for the operating devices corresponding to the switched input is illuminated after receiving the status signal from the television receiver 2, the user can visually recognize the state of the remote control 1 in a simple manner and is prevented from incorrect operation. 23 It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and modifications may occur depending on design requirements and other factors as long as they are within the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents. 1031921"

1776,AT-502014-B1,METHOD FOR CONVERTING EEG MEASURED HEADS TO A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ILLUSTRATION ,2005,"2 AT 502 014 B1 Technical area Medical technology. Measurement of electrical brain waves with an EEG device (EEG = electro-cephalography) and the transformation of these measurements with a proprietary method into a multi-dimensional mapping. Previous state of the art ""Conventional"" EEG: Detection of potential fluctuations in the area of the cerebral cortex with electrodes from the scalp in waveform. Usually, bandwidths of 0.5 - 3.5 Hz, 4 -7 Hz, 8 -13 Hz and 13 - 30 Hz are recorded. Quantitative analysis, data compression analysis, pictorial representation analysis, cCT analysis These EEG forms are only listed because they are all based on the technique of a conventional EEG (see Homma, E., Guide to the EEG practice, p 278-284, 2002: Urban & Fischer, Munich Jena). Magnetic Encephalography (MEG) Special recording devices transform the changes of magnetic fields into voltage fluctuations, yielding curves similar to the EEG. Recording event-related evoked potentials: Under continuous recording with a conventional EEG, a stimulus (clicking sound or light stimulus) is usually presented several hundred times. In a computer analysis, the sensory stimulus following EEG sections are superimposed and averaging. This eliminates the irrelevant spontaneous exchanges, while the always the same event-related potential becomes more and more visible as the number of averaging processes increases. The event-related potential has a characteristic shape: duration: at most 0.5 seconds, amplitude at most 10 mV, short positives. This is called ""P1"" and is marked in the EEG by a deviation down; this is followed by a negative impression. It is represented by an upward deviation and is called N1 or N100 because it occurs after approximately 100 milliseconds. After further rashes there is a clear positivity. It is called a P3 or P300 wave because it occurs after about 300 milliseconds. Technical problem to be solved All cognitive brain functions such as attention, perception, thinking, memory and the affects are based on electrical brain activities. The smallest unit of these electrical activities is the nerve cell (the neuron). The neurons are connected to a neural network. The neural network consists of subnetworks. The technical task that results is to record these electrical brain activities in as much detail as possible in order to obtain electrophysiological representations for brain research and diagnosis, therapy and course monitoring in mental and neurological diseases. The detection of brain electrical activity in waveform (see Figure 2) can not represent these activities in their complexity. 3 AT 502 014 B1 Known analysis methods (RU 2 029 492 C1 27.2.1995 and WO 1990/11718 A1 18.10.1990) are analyzes of conventional EEG waves recorded in the usual bandwidths. In the Russian patent, the bands are individually analyzed for their frequency / amplitude characteristics and their frequency / phase ratios. In the international patent, conventional EEG waves are processed into datasets and compared with datasets from clinical trials. From these comparisons diagnoses are derived. For both patents, the analysis results, which are based on unchanged EEG waves, are shown graphically. The method according to the invention causes the amount of data delivered by an EEG to be displayed in a different form. Instead of a measuring strip with a curve (see Fig. 2), it shows an image in which on the y-axis, the voltages and on the x-axis, the rise steepnesses of two successive measurements are shown (see Fig. 1 u. 3). The measurements are therefore not updated horizontally (see Fig. 2), but 15 superimposed. The accumulation of similar measurements are displayed differently in color by screening. This results in a density structure corresponding to the accumulation of similar measurements. Detailed technical description of the method 20 The values measured by the EEG device are binary coded and have a resolution of two bytes per measured value. One byte can assume 28 states, ie 256 states. At 2 bytes per measured value, a theoretical resolution of 65536 possibilities per measured value is achieved. 25 The decimal value from the 2 bytes of the EEG device is calculated as follows: Value = Hi * 256 + Lo where Hi and Lo are the high byte and low byte of the measured value. 30 In my experiments, it turned out that the hardware just delivers believable readings at a sample frequency of 512 Hz. More readings per second are likely to reduce the accuracy of the individual measurements. 35 For a measurement of half an hour, this means an amount of approx. 900,000 measured values per channel. If this amount of data is displayed as a curve on a screen or printed on paper, this results in a strip of about 1 km. Sifting the data using the traditional method would be very time consuming. With the method according to the invention, the entire measurement is to be displayed on one sheet or more precisely in a grid with a resolution of 100 × 100. This is possible if the data points are entered in a coordinate system where the time axis is missing. The resulting structure thus makes it possible to draw conclusions, e.g. on waveforms, 45 but not on the timing of events. The assignment of the axes has now been chosen as follows: The voltage value is plotted on the vertical axis and the slope of the curve on the horizontal axis. Events that repeat themselves are illustrated by a change in color. A rasterization of the data means that very similar events in the image are represented as ""equal"" or ""repetition"" and a change of color takes place. 4 AT 502 014 B1 Only by screening it is even possible to be able to compare measurements of different lengths. In the experiments, it was found that the signal strength of the measured alternating currents 5 shows great differences in different individuals. This could be due to different texture and thickness of the tissues and bones, as well as different skin resistance. Thus, an adaptation of the data to the grid size is required to compensate for these differences. Furthermore, individual incorrect measurements must be hidden. If you want to see all the data optimally within the grid, it makes sense to search for the highest and lowest measured value, to put it at the upper or lower limit of the grid and to adjust all other values to it. 15 The procedure would be like this: Determine the difference between the lowest measured value and the lower grid size and shift all measured values in parallel by this amount. Then all measured values are above the grid lower limit, the lowest value is still visible. This is then divided by the maximum reading 20 by the grid upper limit and receives the stretch factor by the highest value above the grid upper limit. All values are now divided by this stretch factor and are thus in the visible range. This procedure works only if the EEG does not provide any measurement errors that may well be far beyond the ""normal"" values. With an improved method, these glitches can be elegantly hidden: For this, all measured values must be sorted according to their voltage values. Then you start counting the amount of measurements from the weakest signal until you reach 95% of the total. The signal strength present there is divided by 95 (with a grid of 1 to 100). The result is the stretch factor for all measurements. With this then all present measured values are applied. Extreme values are then outside the grid. 35 The entry of the measured values into the grid takes place according to the following scheme: The raster is a 2-dimensional number space R (x, y) where x and y can assume values of 0..100. R (x, y) is an integer. 40 Let's call 2 consecutive readings a and b. From these values, the difference is calculated, b-a corresponds to the slope of the trace. 45 If the result is positive, this means a rising curve. In the grid, this value corresponds to the deviation on the X-axis. The Y-value is determined according to the formula Y = (a + b) / 2 and corresponds to a point in the middle of the imaginary line between the points a and b. In the grid, the value R (x, y) is increased by 1. How to proceed with all successive measured values of the entire series of measurements. 55"
