6655,ES-2961010-B2,METHOD AND PORTABLE DEVICE FOR ANALYSIS OF FILLING PROCESSES ,2022,"DESCRIPTION Portable method and device for analyzing drawing processes Technical sector The present invention concerns the sector of drawing processes for sheet metal parts, specifically the analysis of the quality of drawing processes. State of the prior art As is known, the process of obtaining a metal part, starting from a sheet of metal of a certain thickness, can have different stages: stamping, shaping, stapling, cutting, punching, bending, etc. Stamping or drawing is the main sheet metal transformation process most frequently used in the manufacture of automobile parts. It is the most important process for obtaining the general shape of the part. Drawing could be defined as the action of transforming a flat sheet into a hollow body. The basic tools involved in a drawing operation are the punch, the die and the press. First, the blank is positioned on the die. Next, the press closes by moving against the die until the blank is in full contact on both sides. When the blank is completely pressed, the press applies a force to the sheet metal that allows the entry of material to be controlled during the drawing process. The punch then pushes the sheet metal against the die, plastically deforming it and obtaining the shape of the cavity. Therefore, although we will talk about stamping from now on, it must be understood in generic terms of generating a certain geometry to a sheet of metal, where there may be other subsequent stages such as bending or stapling after the stamping or stamping itself. Nowadays, the evaluation of the drawing processes is carried out by observing the piece by drawing experts, who give a value of the suitability of the piece obtained by drawing. To carry out these tests, the sheet metal is dyed with paint of a colour. During the drawing process, the dies impact and bend the sheet metal, removing the paint. The expert analyses whether the paint has been correctly removed from the piece; if there is white, it means that the die has removed the paint from that area by abrasion, achieving good drawing. On the other hand, if the piece remains blue, the die has not pressed that area correctly, so the drawing has not been correct. However, it is a subjective procedure. Document CN112098428A discloses a defect recognition system based on artificial vision for the manufacture of sheet materials, with which defects are identified and classified. The system comprises a camera that captures an image of the product and software that filters the image to obtain a background image and then scans each pixel of the image to calculate the difference in grayscale with respect to a reference and classify them using an artificial vision algorithm. However, these types of systems are expensive to implement and not very flexible when analyzing different types of parts, due to the programming or prior training that the system needs to recognize the parts and their position, so these systems are not used for the analysis of the drawing processes prior to mass manufacturing. Therefore, there is a need for a method of analyzing the quality of drawing processes that is carried out automatically and according to objective criteria, while providing flexibility to apply it to different types of parts without added programming or training costs. Description of the invention The present invention relates, according to a first aspect, to a method of analysis of drawing processes for sheet metal parts, the drawing processes being of the type that use a sheet metal part deformation matrix. The analysis method comprises the steps of: a) dyeing a piece of sheet metal to be stamped with a standard colour paint, preferably blue, this stage being able to be carried out by automatic painting means or by manual means, b) embossing the dyed part and obtaining a embossed part by means of a stamping process to be analysed, the matrix removing at least part of the paint in those areas where it comes into contact with the sheet metal part, said contact corresponding to correct embossing when the removal of paint from the surface of the stamped part is complete, while the areas where paint remains on the stamped part correspond to defective embossing, c) selecting, by means of a data input device of the portable device, a virtual representation of a pattern part relative to the drawn part, stored in a memory unit of the portable device. Said selection can be carried out, for example, by manually selecting one of a plurality of virtual representations of the drawn part stored through an interface of the portable device. Unlike those disclosed in the state of the art, the present analysis method is characterized in that it comprises the steps of: (d) capturing, by means of an image capture device of the portable device, the embedded part and displaying it in real time by means of a graphical display device (for example, a screen) of the portable device, (e) displaying on the graphical display device the selected virtual representation superimposed on the captured embedded part, by means of augmented reality, for example, the virtual representation being displayed in a centred manner on the graphical display device, f) manually move the portable device until the superimposed virtual representation matches the embedded part shown in real time, g) analyze, using artificial intelligence algorithms, the degree of paint remaining on the embedded part. This analysis method combines the augmented reality of a portable device with artificial intelligence algorithms. In other words, it uses an efficient and flexible way to capture different stamped parts and match them with their virtual representation. This allows the analysis method to be easily extended to new stamping processes, while using artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize whether the color tone to be identified matches the color tone of the paint that is accepted as correct. Both technologies cooperate in order to reduce the computational cost and simplify the process of analyzing the quality of stamping processes, as it does not require a recognition and discretization program for the stamped parts. In this way, it is possible to accurately delimit and quantify the quantity and visual properties of the remaining paint on the stamped parts and to maintain a history of stamping data that allows for analysis and possible future predictions of the processes. In one possible embodiment, the method comprises, at the same time as the virtual representation is displayed on the graphical display device, altering the transparency of said virtual representation and/or providing adjustment means to adjust the transparency of said virtual representation, so that the operator can visually compare the 3D coincidence of the superposition of the embedded part and the virtual representation. Thus, the simultaneous representation of both the virtual representation of the embedded part and the embedded part to be analysed is permitted, through an alteration of the graphical representation parameters of the virtual representation of the embedded part. The adjustment means may be, for example, a virtual bar located on one side of the screen, which can be moved vertically and the transparency changes depending on the position of the bar. Another example would be to display a “+” button and a “-“ button on the screen to increase or decrease the transparency. In a possible embodiment, the method comprises, after step f), a step 0) of checking the coincidence of the superposition between the virtual representation and the embedded piece shown on the graphical representation device, both of the external profile and of the volumes or surfaces, since the camera could be inclined with respect to the orthogonal of the embedded piece and its surfaces not be coincident with those of the virtual representation. This step is carried out by the software using artificial intelligence algorithms. Preferably, the software issues a warning when the match between volumes or surfaces has been made. According to a preferred embodiment, in order to minimize processing resources, the virtual representation of the embedded piece is only in two dimensions, requiring a match between said surface of the virtual representation and the captured embedded piece. Once said match has been made, the software recovers the three-dimensional geometry of the selected embedded piece from the memory unit of the portable device, in order to be able to perform the analysis of the degree of remaining paint in the different perspectives or approaches of the embedded piece. This simplifies the matching stage, linking the stage performed by augmented reality tools to a match between two-dimensional geometries. Alternatively, said matching or comparison of the coincidence is performed with three-dimensional information, both from the virtual representation of the drawn part and from the drawn part being studied represented, so that the existence of said coincidence is facilitated. In one possible embodiment, the method comprises, preferably after step f) and whether or not it comprises step 6), a step f<2>) of recording at least one image of the embedded part captured by the graphic representation device and storing it in the memory unit of the portable device, this being the at least one image used to carry out step g). Again with the aim of reducing the software processing resources required, the analysis by means of artificial intelligence algorithms of the degree of paint remaining on the embedded part is carried out on specific images captured by the user through the image capture device of the portable device, instead of a real-time processing and analysis of the degree of paint remaining on the embedded part captured by said device. Optionally, step g) comprises removing the non-embossed environment from the at least one image of the embossed part, allowing the volume or surface of the embossed part to be determined exactly. For example, step g) comprises applying a black/white filter to the at least one image of the embossed part. In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises, prior to step g), a step f<3>) of delimiting in the stamped piece study areas corresponding to the areas to be analyzed in step g). Specifically, the areas of main interest for studying the stamping quality correspond to the perimeter areas of the stamped piece. In this way, the analysis step g) focuses on said areas of greatest interest. In a preferred implementation, step f<3>) of delimiting the study areas comprises transferring, by means of augmented reality, boundaries defining said study areas to the at least one captured image of the embedded part, said boundaries being previously defined in the virtual representation. In this way, the augmented reality libraries recognise the specific study areas (defined by the previously defined boundaries) of the at least one captured image of the embedded part, so that the artificial intelligence algorithms applied to analyse the degree of paint remaining on the embedded part are applied only to said study areas delimited by augmented reality. Optionally, in step f<3>), said boundaries can be manually refined or modified by tactilely marking said areas on the graphical display device or screen (for example, the manually marked areas can be areas to be extracted from the study areas). As a result, stage g) of analysing the degree of paint remaining on the embedded part using artificial intelligence algorithms is carried out only in the delimited study areas of the embedded part. In this way, in a single stage, augmented reality and artificial vision algorithms are applied to reduce the computational cost of analysing the embedded part. For example, the step of transferring said boundaries comprises superimposing lines of a predefined colour, different from the standard colour, on the at least one captured image of the embedded part, by means of augmented reality. In this case and preferably, step f<3>) of delimiting the study areas additionally comprises applying a detection filter of the predefined colour and carrying out a detection of said predefined colour pixel by pixel to determine the lines of predefined colour superimposed by means of augmented reality on the captured image of the embedded part. In this way, the study areas to be analysed are delimited. In one possible embodiment, step g) comprises performing a pixel-by-pixel scan to analyse the degree of similarity between the hue of each pixel and the standard colour stored in the memory device of the portable device. Preferably, the standard colour stored in the memory device of the portable device with which said degree of similarity is to be analysed comprises a range of tones, preferably calibratable, either by providing calibration means to manually calibrate said range of similarity or by the software calibrating it automatically. Optionally, the method comprises an additional step of calculating the correct embossing percentage based on the degree of similarity between the hue of each pixel and the standard colour made during the pixel-by-pixel scanning of the captured image of the embossed part. Said calculation can be carried out for portions of the embossed part, dividing the image of the embossed part into a grid. In the same way, the portable device can display on the screen the result obtained for each portion of the grid. A second aspect of the present invention consists of a portable device for analyzing drawing processes for sheet metal parts, which comprises: - a memory unit configured to store virtual representations of drawn parts, - a data input device, configured to allow the selection of one of the virtual representations stored in the memory unit, - an image capture device configured to capture images, - a graphic representation device configured to represent the captured images in real time, - a control unit, operatively connected to the memory unit, the data input device, the image capture device and the graphic display device, where the control unit is configured to: or control the graphic representation device to represent, by means of augmented reality, the selected virtual representation superimposed on a captured image of a stamped part, or determine a coincidence in the superposition between the selected virtual representation and the captured image of the stamped part, in response to manual movements of the portable device, and or analyze, using artificial intelligence algorithms, the degree of remaining paint in the captured image of the embedded piece. The objective of the present invention is to implement in a portable device, therefore, movable by the user to be able to analyze in any situation, location and state the quality of drawing of a drawn piece, where the portable device has an image capture system, a software that combines Augmented Reality with Artificial Vision, seeking that the analysis of the drawing quality is carried out automatically and according to objective criteria. Brief description of the drawings The above and other advantages and features will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of some embodiments with reference to the attached drawings, which should be taken as illustrative and not limiting, in which: - Fig. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing the order of the steps of an exemplary embodiment of the present method of analysis of drawing processes. - Fig. 2 illustrates an example image reproduced by a graphical display device of the portable device used during step e) of the present method. - Fig. 3 illustrates another example image consisting of the virtual representation superimposed coincidentally with the embedded part when carrying out step e) of the present method. - Fig. 4 illustrates an example of the application of stage f<3>), which shows the predefined limits in the virtual representation to be transferred to the captured image of the embedded part by means of augmented reality. - Fig. 5 illustrates an image exemplifying the application in stage f<3>) of a predefined color detection filter to determine the study areas. - Fig. 6 illustrates an example image showing the calculation of the correct embossing percentage based on the degree of similarity between the hue of each pixel of the embossed piece and the standard color. Detailed description of some examples of implementation Figure 1 shows a block diagram showing the order of the steps of an exemplary embodiment of the present method of analysis of drawing processes for sheet metal parts. This embodiment comprises the steps of: a) dyeing a piece (1) of sheet metal to be stamped with paint of a standard color, said stage being carried out manually by an operator or automatically by a painting team, b) embossing the dyed piece (1) and obtaining a embossed piece (1) by means of a embossing process, c) selecting, by means of a data input device of a portable device, a virtual representation (2) of the drawn part (1), stored in a memory unit of the portable device, d) capture, by means of an image capture device of the portable device, the embedded part (1) and display it in real time by means of a graphic representation device of the portable device, e) represent on the graphic display device the selected virtual representation (2) superimposed on the captured embedded piece (1), by means of augmented reality, f) manually moving the portable device until the selected virtual representation (2) matches the embedded part (1) shown in real time, 0) checking the coincidence of the superposition between the virtual representation (2) and the embedded part (1) shown on the graphical representation device, f<2>) recording and storing in the memory unit of the portable device at least one image of the embedded part (1), once a coincidence in the superposition between the virtual representation (2) and the embedded part (1) has been determined, f<3>) delimiting in the at least one recorded image of the embedded part (1) study areas (10) corresponding to the areas to be analyzed in step g), based on limits (20) that define said study areas (10), which are previously defined in the virtual representation (2), g) analyze, using artificial intelligence algorithms, the degree of remaining paint in the study areas (10) of the embedded piece (1). Fig. 2 illustrates an example image reproduced by a graphic display device of the portable device used during step e) of the present method. This image in Fig. 2 shows the virtual representation (2) relating to an example embedded part (1), as well as a portion of said embedded part (1) captured in real time with the image capture device of the portable device. It can be seen how the embedded part (1) is not entirely included in the field of view of the image capture device of the portable device, so it appears cut off. On the other hand, it can be seen how the virtual representation (2) previously selected by the user relating to the embedded part (1) appears represented in the centre of the graphic display device. Said representation is also altered in terms of its transparency, allowing the user to simultaneously observe both said virtual representation (2) and the real-time image captured of the embedded part (1). Fig. 3 shows another example image reproduced by the graphic display device at the moment when the user, by moving the portable device, has made the virtual representation (2) coincide in an overlapping manner with the piece (1) embedded during step e) of the present method. By means of the augmented reality representation, a coincidence between both representations of the piece is allowed. Fig. 4 illustrates an example of application of stage f<3>), in which the predefined limits (20) of the virtual representation (2) to be transferred to the image of the embedded piece (1) by means of augmented reality are shown, which define the study areas (10) to be analyzed of the embedded piece (1) in stage g), while the manually marked areas (21) that must be extracted from the study areas (10) are shown. Consequently, once the coincidence between the embedded part (1) and its virtual representation (2) has been determined, the control unit captures different images of the embedded part (1) by means of the image capture device. These images are stored in the memory unit. The control unit recovers the three-dimensional information of the part to be studied stored in the memory unit of the portable device in order to establish a coincidence between the different perspectives of the different images of the embedded part (1) captured. By means of the corresponding augmented reality libraries, limits (20) are established that define study areas (10) corresponding to the areas to be analyzed in stage g). Said delimitation of the study areas (10) allows the computer vision analysis to be executed only on said study areas.
