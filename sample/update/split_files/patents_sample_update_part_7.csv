3174,NL-2004503-C2,Method and device for charging a battery and battery charger. ,2010,"Method and device for charging a battery and battery charger The present invention relates to a method and device for charging a battery. More in particular the method relates to a method for shortening the charging time of (li-ion) 5 batteries with a low temperature prior to charging or at the beginning of a charging process, without damaging the battery or shortening its life. Short charging times for batteries are desired in certain applications, for example when the batteries power an electric vehicle that needs to be used. However, short charging 10 times require large currents, which have an impact on battery life. This negative effect even increases when the battery temperature is lower, resulting for example in damage to the battery caused by an effect known as lithium plating inside the battery. It is a goal of the present invention to provide a method and device for charging a 15 battery, in particular a lithium-ion battery that decreases the charging time at a low starting temperature, and that has a minimum impact on battery life. It is a further goal of the present invention to provide a method that is useful to improve the battery life under a certain given charging pattern or usage scenario. 20 The invention thereto proposes a method for charging a battery, comprising heating a battery if a battery temperature is below a low-threshold temperature, and charging the battery when the battery temperature is above the low-threshold temperature. 25 The low-threshold temperature depends on the battery and may be varied in dependence of the battery type used. An average value may for example be at room temperature, i.e. about 20 degrees Celcius. By heating the battery, a larger charging current may be used, and the charging process can be performed quicker, without damaging the battery. The heating may be performed by a specific heating component such as an electric spiral or 30 the like, or in hybrid cars with an combustion engine, the battery may be incorporated in the cooling system of the combustion engine, to receive heat deducted thereof. As an alternative, heating may comprise generating dissipation energy in the battery by applying a current with at least an AC component to the battery. Dissipation then takes 2 place in the internal resistance of the battery. This has not only the advantage that the heat is generated exactly at the location where it is required, so that a high efficiency is obtained, but it also doesn’t require any additional hardware of modifications, both in the battery, and in the charger. 5 The connection between the charger and the battery is typically a conductor. This can be charging cable, for example with conductive connector or the DC bus of a vehicle (e.g. when using an on-board charger or motor controller for charging). Also an inductive coupling can be used. Such an inductive coupling already supplies AC current, that can 10 be used to heat up the battery. For that the rectifier and or a low-pass filter may be switched on or off. The battery may be a traction battery in particular a Li-ion battery and even more specific a Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFeP04) battery. The battery may have a BMS that 15 may be altered or temporarily switched off or changed to a different mode to accept the PWM signal. This may be done by changing the software of the BMS. The battery may be a part of a grid storage buffer used for peak-shaving, in particular associated with a vehicle charging station. 20 The heating can also occur during, at the end and/or near the end of charging to heat up the battery for use in cold conditions, such as cold weather, cold-storage warehouse, high altitude, space, in polar regions, at night or near cooling machinery such as on an artificial ice track. Also a heated battery has less losses during use. 25 The temperature of the battery may be measured or estimated by measuring cooling water or gas of the battery, in particular the difference between entering and exiting coolant. The temperature may be estimated from other temperatures such as cabin temperature (air-conditioning sensor), ambient temperature (measured by the car) or the motor drive temperature. The latter can be an indication of motor usage and therefore 30 battery usage. The temperature may alternatively be estimated from the date or time and geographic location or based on the temperature of batteries of other vehicles. The battery temperature information can be communicated to the controller through any means. For example the information can be communicated from the vehicle or 3 battery to the charger through the charging cable. The information can be communicated through a computer network, such as a LAN or an internet connection. A vehicle can be equipped with a wireless communication device that communicates this information directly or indirectly (e.g. through an internet server) to the charger. 5 Preferably, the average current towards the battery is positive, for charging the battery during heating. This leads to an even shorter overall charging time, and to more energy effectiveness. 10 A suitable waveform for this purpose is a one-directional DC current. The actual value of the current may be changed, as will be explained in the following, but the energy flow is only toward the battery, so that no discharge (costing extra time) takes place during heating. 15 To obtain a controllable one directional current, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) may be applied. This waveform can usually be supplied by a standard battery charger, and it causes relatively high dissipation, thus contributing to a quick temperature rise, and as a result to a short charging time. The duty cycle of the PWM and thus the average current may then be controlled as a function of the battery temperature. 20 It is advantageous when the edges of the PWM pulses are rounded to avoid or at least reduce electromagnetic interference due to harmonics. Rounding the pulses may be done by making use of (parasitic or internal) capacitances or inductances, but more sophisticated (digital) charging equipment may be programmable to generate any 25 desired waveform. Besides pulse PWM, also Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) can be applied, and it is even thinkable that sinusoidal pulses are used, in which again PWM (which then for example causes a phase cut signal) or PDM can be applied. The choice for a waveform 30 may be dependent on the charger used, and the sensitivity to specific harmonics of the environment of the battery to be charged. The average current may be dependent on the temperature of the battery, which may be measured, or estimated based on a starting environment temperature and an estimated 4 cumulative dissipation. Both the desired (average) current, and a desired (maximum) temperature as an estimated cumulative dissipation may further be obtained from an external source, such as a vehicle or battery management system, or an external database with battery characteristics. 5 The dependence of the average current on the temperature may be adapted for each specific battery, but preferably at least in a temperature interval, the average current is doubled for every 5-15, and in particular for about every 10 degrees of temperature increase. 10 When the battery is above the threshold temperature, constant current charging or declining (continuous / non switched) current charging may be applied, the declining current charging for example obtained by constant voltage charging. 15 A constant-current charging at a level that is only limited by the battery of charger or grid specifications leads to the quickest energy transfer possible. Constant current charging may take place at the peak value of the PWM charging, but it is also possible that the peaks of the PWM charging are chosen above the constant current level. This is possible, since with a PWM signal, that comprises current-free intervals, components, in 20 particular those of the charger, may be operated above their maximum values, which are usually determined for constant currents, voltages or power. According to the invention, current reduction may be applied when the battery temperature exceeds a high-threshold temperature or a predetermined voltage or a 25 predetermined state of charge, or a predetermined charging time. Current reduction usually leads to decreasing dissipation within the battery. Herewith, overtemperature is avoided during the charging process. Such a current reduction can be achieved by applying constant voltage (CV) charging or constant temperature charging. 30 The invention further proposes a battery charging apparatus, configured to perform a method as described above. The charging apparatus may be a programmable or controllable charging apparatus. 5 When applying PWM, the apparatus may be operated above its nominal level, since PWM comprises low-current timeslots, in which the components can cool down, enabling them to withstand higher peaks in the timeslots wherein current is conducted. 5 It is also possible to configure the battery charging apparatus to charge a plurality of batteries at a time, wherein a PWM signal for a second vehicle is set high when the PWM signal for a first vehicle is low. The output of the charger is then switched between the batteries to be charged. The actual current level that can be reached in this situation depends on the total duty cycle of the charger, when charging the plurality of 10 batteries. It is also possible to switch between a charging current of a battery, and a heating element for said battery. Herewith, an optimum charging time can be reached. The invention will now be elucidated into more detail with reference to the following non limitative figures, wherein: 15 - Figures la and lb show charging currents for a battery according to the present invention; Figures 2a and 2b show schematic overviews of a system for applying the present invention; Figures 3a-3f show embodiments of a PWM converter according to the present 20 invention; - Figures 4a-4f show process flows of a system making use of the present invention. Figure la shows a schematic charging curve of a current during battery charge 25 according to the present invention. The charging curve comprises the three following modes. A low temperature PWM mode A, wherein the battery is heated. Figure la schematically shows that during mode A, the current waveform does not necessarily need to be a square wave. A normal charging mode B wherein a steady charge current is used not to generate more losses than necessary. A high temperature mode C wherein 30 the battery current is reduced to prevent the battery from overheating. A steady (declining) charge current is used not to generate more losses than necessary. The low temperature PWM mode A is typically at the beginning or at early stage of the charging process. It is intended to heat up the battery. The battery is also charged during 6 this phase. Arrhenius’s law states that chemical processes in batteries are strongly dependent on temperature. A battery that can be charged in 30 minutes at room temperature cannot be charged that fast at lower temperatures. Attempting to do so can result in damage to the battery. Heating up the battery at the beginning of charge 5 therefore enables faster charging. In particular an average charging current that is divided by roughly two for every 10°C drop in temperature gives good results. For example: at 20°C the battery is charged at 16A. At 10°C it is charged at 8A, at 0°C at 4A, at -10°C at 2A and at -20°C at 1A and so forth. The function may be approximated by using other functions, such as steps or polynomial, linear or goniometrie functions. 10 The benefit of using low temperature PWM with compared to using an AC current to heat up the battery is that this mode can be performed using components that are normally used in a charger. Therefore it requires minimal change to the system. 15 The benefit of using low temperature PWM with compared to using a large charging current to heat up the battery it that the damage to the battery will be lower when using a PWM charging. When using a large current, the internal battery voltages will rise, damaging the battery. 20 Using the PWM charging will result in lower voltages because the average current is lower. This gives less strain on the battery when heating the battery at the same moment. In an embodiment the pulses are rounded to reduce electro-magnetic interference. The 25 pulses may be sinusoidal. The roundness of the pulses may be generated by controlling the charge current rather than relying on a low pass filter. In another embodiment the height of the charging pulses can be made higher than the specifications of the components (e.g. power converter, cables, charging connector), 30 because the components have a resting period to cool down due to the PWM. That way a 125A charger can be used at a 50% duty cycle at 175A, without wearing down the components more than necessary. 7 Because it can be expected that this situation will arise at low ambient temperatures, the charger can also be used at an (even higher) rating, because ambient air temperature is lower. 5 This charging mode can also be used to heat up the components of the charger or other components of the vehicle, such as the charging cable making it more flexible and easier to handle in cold weather. It is further possible to use a charger device to switch charging current between the 10 batteries. If the batteries each only have half the capacity of one big battery, the charging current is also half. Therefore the charging connector, cables and charger can be smaller. The frequency of the duty cycle is usually in the range of 0.01Hz - 100kHz. For 15 Lithium-ion batteries a low frequency is beneficial to prevent (paracitic) capacitance and use real Ohmic resistance as much as possible. A too low frequency will result in a too high voltage rise, damaging the battery. The frequency of the duty cycle (the time of ton and t0ff) can also be chosen to match the 20 response time of the charger. For instance of the ramp-up time of the charger is one second a frequency of 0.1 Hz can be used. The low temperature PWM mode is usually followed by a mode B wherein the charge current is not limited by temperature. In a typical case a steady charge current is used 25 not to generate more losses than necessary. In this mode the current may still rise with temperature, but the duty cycle is absent. This is particularly useful when the current is large enough to heat up the battery and a PWM in his case would result in too high temperature or a too high temperature for a later stage of the charging process. 30 In a third mode C the current is gradually reduced, to stop generating heat in the battery. With respect to using a PWM to reduce (average) charging current is that PWM introduces unnecessary losses in the battery, while the goal of reducing the current is to reduce losses. When temperature is the major limiting factor for the charging system, mode A can be followed by mode C directly. 8 A (part of a) charging output filter of a charger may be reconfigured when using mode A charging to enable better PWM performance. The reconfiguration can be done by bypassing parts of the filter. This can be done by using switches (e.g. relays, transistors) 5 that shunt or disconnect inductors and/or capacitors. Another embodiment has an isolation detection circuit. This circuit detects if galvanic isolation is maintained. The isolation circuit itself is not that important, because these are readily available components. What is important: The isolation detection in the 10 vehicle or the charger is (temporarily) disabled during charge. This is because the isolation monitor may be confused by the pulsing currents. Another embodiment uses the battery voltage, impedance or frequency response as a way to regulate the PWM. The impedance can be determined by applying an AC current 15 or AC current component to the battery. In particular the PWM itself can be used as an impedance measurement. For example at the PWM on-phase the voltage rise is monitored. When the voltage crosses a certain threshold the current is reduced or set to zero. The voltage will then 20 fall. After a period of time or when the voltage drops below a threshold the current is switched back on again. Figure lb shows a situation, wherein the temperature drops during the charging (for example due to a low environmental temperature), and the charging switches back to 25 PWM, as is indicated with D in curve 1’. Figure 2a shows a first schematic overview 2 of a system according to the present invention. The simplest embodiment of this system comprises a charger 4 which is connected to a vehicle 3 and can communicate with said vehicle and more specifically 30 the BMS of the battery by means of some channel such as a wireless communications system, through the charge cable 5 (either separate contacts or communication over the same pins as the charge current) or any other system for said communication. It can then obtain the battery temperatures from a BMS, and based on these temperatures modify the charge current. In this embodiment the charger has all details and algorithms 9 concerning this low-temperature stored locally, and can autonomously decide to apply these. For other tasks such as selecting the standard charge currents and prioritizing of vehicles it can still connect to a remote server. 5 It is also possible that the charger 4 has reduced local intelligence and data storage. The decision to use the low-temperature charging algorithm is made by a remote decision and storage facility 6 (shown in dashed lines), and also all parameters for this algorithm are calculated and decided by this facility. This has as advantages that the charger can be made much cheaper, as less logics and data storage is required. Besides, performance 10 of many chargers in the field can be upgraded in one go, as the code and parameters for the algorithm only have to be replaced in one place, and not all chargers have to be upgraded separately. Furthermore, the charger may be coupled to a temperature sensing device 7, which may 15 be integrated in the battery, or form part of a battery management system. In another embodiment, the optional temperature sensing device lacks, and the charger is unable to obtain the actual temperature from the BMS of the vehicle. In this embodiment (which might work independently from the presence of a remote server) the temperature of the battery will have to be estimated or measured based on other methods. These methods 20 may be one or a combination of the following methods: • Use the ambient temperature measured by the charger. Preferably here the estimation is backed up by statistical data which correlates environmental temperature with the batteries temperature for increased reliability. A precise model which models the battery temperature change caused by charging current is required to keep the 25 estimate accurate during the charge process; • Use some infra-red sensing device to measure the heat radiated by the battery section of a car; • If no local temperature measurement is available for whatever reason, weather measurements or forecast which could be available from a remote server can be used for 30 a temperature estimation. Also for this solution it would be preferable to have some sort of statistical relation between ambient temperature and battery temperature; • A relation can be made between internal resistance of a battery and its temperature. As soon as the type of battery is known, its temperature can be estimated preferably when its age and SOH (State of Health) are known by applying a certain 10 predetermined current and measuring the instant voltage rise (or drop) to serve as a basis for temperature estimation; • When the BMS of the car returns multiple temperature values, an average, a maximum or a minimum of these values may be used as input for the charging 5 algorithm. When the difference between these multiple temperature values is known, the algorithm may be devised in such a way that it will not overheat the warmest parts of the battery, even when the low temperature of other parts is still limiting the average charge current; • When more is known about the construction of the battery pack and the relative 10 position of the different temperatures the average mentioned above can be a weighted average, where the weighting can be based on knowledge of the sensor positions, optimality knowledge of the charging algorithm or other prior knowledge. This battery data can also be combined with ambient temperature values, for instance for averaging one temperature value from the centre of the pack with the ambient temperature to 15 obtain the average temperature in the pack. The method to effectuate the low frequency PWM signal on the battery may be implemented in many ways, while leaving the essence of the invention intact. The following list contains possible embodiments of the PWM system: 20 • The output of a power converter with a DC output can be connected and disconnected from the battery by means of a relay. • To save on wear said relay can be replaced by a solid-state relay, MOSFET, IGBT or other semiconductor technology. • As said power converter may be susceptible to damage caused by 25 abovementioned switching devices the PWM signal can be generated by applying a low-power PWM signal to the control input(s) of the power converter. • When the used power converter is embodied by an on-board charger, the idea of the invention can still be applied by switching on and off the AC current fed to the onboard charger. Care has to be taken that the on-board charger does not apply some 30 temperature correction itself as this might unnecessarily increase the charge time. If none of the above methods for obtaining a temperature measurement are present, it is possible to derive the temperature indirectly, since the I-Y characteristic of a battery changes with its temperature. This embodiment skips the measurement of the 11 temperature and just uses a high charge current. Due to higher internal resistance, a certain voltage threshold will be reached earlier. When the power converter is switched off at this threshold, and a certain time delay is implemented before it is switched on again, the idea of temperature dependent PWM pulse charging is still intact, but 5 temperature sensing is eliminated. For determination of the current, determination of the time delay and actuation of the current ideas from aforementioned embodiments can be used without fundamentally altering the idea of the invention. Figure 2b shows a second schematic view 8 of a system for performing the method 10 according to the present invention, wherein a DC power supply (charger) 9 is coupled to a grid or DC-Bus 10. A BMS 12 of the battery 11 senses the temperature of the battery and passes this information on to the charger 9. This charger 9 is augmented with a temperature charging controller 13. The TCC 13 identifies the BMS 12 and sets the DC power supply current and voltage. The TCC 13 decides, based on the temperature and 15 the battery type what the PWM duty cycle should be, and controls the DC power supply 9 to switch off and on accordingly. A PWM duty cycle is determined, based on an exponential decay of charge current with relation to battery temperature. In an embodiment where multiple batteries are charged, two or more vehicles can be 20 charged with a single power source if the power for one vehicle is “on” while for the other vehicles it is “off’. Figure 3a shows yet another schematic view 14 of a system according to the present invention. A controller 15 can be a microcontroller a (web)server, a part of the power 25 converter 16 (Such as a semi-conductor driver or electronics used to control the semiconductor drivers). The controller 15 can be an analog or digital circuit, such as a multivibrator. The multivibrator can be controlled by changing the time contant and the amplitude by for instance changing the resistor(s) or capacitor(s) value(s) depending on (battery) temperature. In particular one or more of the resistors of the multivibrator can 30 be an NTC, PTC or transistor (e.g. field effect transistor) or one or more of the capacitors can be a variable capacitor (varicap). The PTC and NTC can be used to change the behaviour of the multivibrator dependent on (battery) temperature (for instance because the PTC or NTC is placed near or inside 12 the battery. The transistor and varicap are voltage dependent and can be used to change the behaviour of the multivibrator dependent on battery voltage, which can be an indication of the battery temperature. For that, the battery voltage may pass through an AM detection circuit. These components can be near or inside the battery 17, while the 5 rest of the circuit is near the charger (that may be outside the vehicle). The battery 17 has a temperature 18 which is determined by a temperature sensor 19 that sends the measured value to the controller 15. Figure 3b shows how the controller 15 can be a fuzzy logic circuit or a logic circuit with 10 fuzzy logic programming. Depending on memberships of the parameters (e.g. Temperature, voltage, Set current) a different or combined control algorithm can be implemented, for example comprising the modes A, B and C from figures la and lb. The controller 15 may be trained using training data or real life situations. The 15 controller 15 could therefore best comprise an adaptive system, such as a neural network. The controller can be a part of a cloud computing network. It can make its own decisions and/or leave solutions to partial decisions to other computers. The controller 15 can comprise or use a database that holds information about vehicles, batteries and environmental parameters. 20 Figure 3c shows an embodiment 20 with a hardware or software structure for a system that can have blocks for the different charging modes/phases. An event (e.g. change of temperature) can make the system switch to operate in one or more of the other modes. 25 Figure 3d shows another embodiment 21 with a current control that gets input from (optional) hardware or software that changes the current based on various factors. For instance a low-temperature module can change the duty cycle of the current. Under normal temperature the duty cycle is 100% (full current) but at lower temperatures the duty cycle becomes smaller. The high temperature control may lower the current value 30 (amplitude) in case of high temperature. An high voltage control module may reduce the charging current in case of high voltage (constant voltage charging). A time target module may reduce te current if the vehicle has no urgency to leave soon. The modules for low and high temperature control may be a single module for temperature control. 13 The controller can be connected to the power converter using a network connection (e.g TCP/IP). The connection between the controller and the power converter can be analog, such as a direct PWM control signal or parametric (0-1OV for amplitude and 0-10V for duty cycle and/or frequency). The connection between the controller and the power 5 converter can be digital control such as RS232, RS485,12C, CAN or SPI. The connection between the controller and the power converter can be a PWM control that gives parametric signals (0-100% for amplitude and 0-100% for duty cycle). The controller can directly control a switch (e.g. relay or semiconductor) control signal that switches the input or output current of the power converter. This may be implemented 10 in the vehicle while the rest of the power converter is inside or outside the vehicle. The connection between the controller and the power converter can be optical (e.g. using LDR or optocoupler). This is in particular interesting to maintain galvanic isolation. The controller may control a switch that switches the power converter between two vehicles. This way a single power converter can be used to charge multiple 15 vehicles. The power converter can be inside a vehicle or in a charging station or another type of charger. The power converter may be a regular power supply, such as a switch-mode power supply. The power supply may be a phase control dimmer. 20 Figure 3e shows how using such a dimmer provides a basic way to change the frequency of the pulsed current (by skipping some of the phase pulses) and the amplitude. 25 An instable power supply such as aforementioned dimmer, a welding transformer or a low-cost power supply can be used to generate the PWM signal. Optionally a stabilisation stage that can be switched on or off can be added to stabilise the power when no PWM is required. The system can include a stable power supply for stable current and a signal generator of any sort to create the PWM signal. The PWM can be 30 generated by the motor controller, that may function as or as a part of the charging circuit. 14 Figure 3f shows an embodiment 22 wherein the PWM can be coupled in from the net through a capacitor or an alternative 23 with a transformer that can be switched on or off. 5 Figures 4a-4f show process flows of a system making use of the present invention. Figure 4a shows an embodiment wherein the system can optimize the charge speed through application of a data processing methods which make trade offs between battery life, charge speed and battery temperature.

The battery knowledge base can be a large internet based storage system, but it can also be a small software program or register in the BMS or computer of the vehicle, or a small software program somewhere in the charger. 25 5. The data processing device calculates the best charging method for this situation: it requests the relationships between battery life, charge speed and temperature from a battery knowledge base. Based on this information it decides that the battery should be heated first before commencing fast charging. It tells the energy exchange station that it should preheat the battery by applying a pulsed current for a defined period of time and 30 afterwards applying a fast charge at a defined level for several minutes. 6.

The energy exchange station applies a pulsed current for several minutes followed by a fast charge at a defined level for several minutes. Figure 4c shows an embodiment wherein the system can optimize the charge speed through application of a data processing methods which make trade offs between 30 battery life, charge speed and battery temperature. A data processing device in this specific embodiment initially decides that a slow charge is enough but when input from a service provider is received it decides to speed up charging by initially applying a short battery pre-heat and then an accelerated fast charge 16 In figure 4c the following belongs to the corresponding boxes: 1.

This input tells the system that the battery must be charged as quickly as possible because another vehicle will arrive within a few minutes. 20 8. Based on the new information the data processing device decides that charging has to be changed: first the battery has to be heated by a pulsed current or by using an onboard heating device and then the highest possible charge rate has to be applied. 9. The energy exchange system changes the charging method according to 8, heats the battery and applies the highest possible charge rate. 25 Figure 4d shows an embodiment wherein the system can optimize the charge speed through application of a data processing methods which make trade offs between battery life, charge speed and battery temperature.

3496,NL-2006876-C2,"VEHICLE, SYSTEM FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING OPTICAL SIGNALS, AND METHODS. ",2011,"P94648NL00 Title: Vehicle, system for receiving and sending optical signals, and methods An aspect of the invention relates to a vehicle. A further aspect of the invention relates to a system for sending and receiving optical signals. In addition, the invention relates to a method for receiving and / or sending optical signals An example of said system is a device to be mounted on a vehicle for detecting optical signals from a vehicle speed monitor (e.g. a ""laser gun""), wherein the device can send back laser pulses to disturb the speed monitor. Examples of laser transponders are described, for example, in US 5,793,476 (Laakman et al.), For example a laser transponder developed by the Lidatek company. The known transponder is arranged to be placed on the front of a vehicle, to detect incoming optical signals (for example coming from a speed monitor) and to send back interference signals. A large number of different methods are known for determining the optical interference signals, for example transmission of a fixed pattern (independent of the incoming signals), or transmission of interference signals that are specifically dependent on observed signals. One of the disadvantages of the known system is that installation as such is relatively difficult. In addition, it is generally difficult to find a suitable location for the transponder. Such a transponder, for example, usually has to be mounted on a vehicle front, such that it can receive incoming optical signals well, and to send back interference signals in a suitable direction. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to arrange the transponder in such a way that it does not detract from the appearance of the vehicle. In addition, the installed transponder can easily be damaged by objects incoming during use, and is subject to rain and wind. The use of a single transponder does not always lead to good results. For example, certain vehicle speed monitors irradiate only a relatively small part of a vehicle. For this reason, it has been proposed in known systems to provide a vehicle on the outside with different transponders at different locations, so that incoming signals can be detected at different locations. That is a relatively expensive solution, and increases the above problems. Furthermore, the use of different transponders, arranged at a distance from one another, leads to a considerable increase in the use of electrical cabling to interconnect the various components, which increases the susceptibility to interference. The present invention has for its object to solve the aforementioned problems. In particular, the invention contemplates an improved vehicle. According to a further aspect, the invention contemplates a reliable and durable system that can be installed relatively easily. A vehicle according to the invention is characterized by the features of claim 1. The vehicle is provided with: at least one optical passage located at a vehicle exterior for transmitting optical signals; and at least one elongated optical signal conductor, which extends between said passage and at least one optical signal processing unit located in the vehicle. The vehicle provided by the invention offers various advantages. In particular, incoming optical signals, for example, can be received via said optical passage for being supplied to the signal processing unit by the elongated signal conductor for further processing. In addition, the optical signal processing unit can for instance generate optical signals and transmit the vehicle via a said elongated signal conductor and a respective optical passage. During use, the vehicle may, for example, receive only one or more optical signals via a said optical passage and respective elongated signal conductor, or only send one or more optical signals via a said optical passage and the signal conductor, or both receive one or more optical signals as send via the passage and conductor. The optical signals can serve various purposes here, for instance determining a distance between the vehicle and an object located in an environment of the vehicle, a measurement of the speed of the vehicle itself (for example using a series of said distance determinations) , disruption of an external vehicle speedometer, remote control of, for example, a gate or garage door, or a combination of these or other applications. According to a further elaboration, each said signal conductor is an elongated flexible signal conductor. Such a signal conductor can be easily installed and laid along a suitable path in the vehicle. Preferably, the conductors are simply placed in the vehicle V, whereby they are passed through existing openings in the vehicle (for instance between different compartments in the vehicle V). The signal conductor can be of relatively thin design, for example with a maximum outer dimension (e.g. diameter) of no more than 3 cm, in particular a maximum of 2 cm or less, for example approximately 16 mm. The signal conductor can, for example, comprise at least one optical fiber (for example a glass fiber). The signal conductor can be relatively long, preferably with a length of more than approximately 0.5 m, for example at least approximately 1 m. In addition, said signal conductor can for instance 4 have a length of less than approximately 0.5 m, for example a length of at least one cm. The optical passage, which is for instance located in an outside of the vehicle, can be designed in various ways. The optical passage can for instance comprise an opening, or a window which is provided with a light-transmitting material, or be configured otherwise. A maximum transverse dimension of said optical passage can for instance be smaller than 5 mm, so that the passage is hardly visible from an environment of the vehicle. Incidentally, said optical passage can also have a different dimension, for example with a larger maximum transverse dimension. The optical passage can for instance comprise at least a part of a gap or opening in an outer side of the vehicle, for instance a gap or opening between adjacent vehicle parts, for example body parts, lighting, license plate, bumper, air passage (s) and / or other components . The vehicle can for instance be provided with at least two said optical passages, for instance at a mutual distance of more than approximately 10 cm. In that case, at least two respective elongate signal conductors can be provided for transmission of optical signals to and / or of each of said passages. One or more said passages may, for example, be located at a front side, viewed in a main direction of travel, of the vehicle, in order to transmit and / or receive optical signals to an area in front of the vehicle. Furthermore, one or more said passages may be located at the rear (viewed in a main direction of travel) of the vehicle, for exchange of optical signals with an area behind the vehicle. In addition, one or more said passages may be located on one or both sides of the vehicle. 5 Said optical processing unit can be arranged at a suitable location in the vehicle, for instance in or near a passenger room, on a dashboard, at a center console next to the driver, in an engine compartment, under a hood, and in any case preferably at relatively large distance from said optical passage. The processing unit can thus be arranged in the vehicle at a suitable safe location. In this way, it is moreover possible to prevent such a component from disturbing the appearance of the vehicle. The optical signal conductor can optically transfer optical signals between the processing unit and optical passage, so that the use of possible electrical cabling is avoided or considerably limited. This leads to a particularly trouble-free operation. The optical processing unit can itself be designed in various ways, which depends, for example, on the desired application or applications. The optical processing unit can for instance be provided with at least one receiver for receiving optical signals transmitted through a said signal conductor (incoming via a respective passage). An optical processing unit can be provided with at least one transmitter for transmitting optical signals via a said signal conductor. An additional affordable transmitter includes a laser. More in particular, at least one optical processing unit can be provided which is provided with both one or more light signal transmitters and one or more light signal receivers. Furthermore, the optical processing unit can for instance be provided with a housing, which has one or more optical connection ports for connecting said one or more optical signal conductors. According to a further elaboration, the optical processing unit comprises at least one data processor, arranged for processing data related to said optical signals. Such a data processor can for instance be 6 configured to cooperate with a said transmitter and / or receiver for the purpose of sending and / or receiving optical signals. It is then particularly advantageous if the data processor has information that is related to a length of said optical signal conductor, in particular for the purpose of determining an optical path length by the respective conductor. More in particular, the data processor may be adapted to use information related to the length of at least one said optical signal conductor in processing information concerning optical signals to be transmitted and / or received. With such information, the data processor can provide an extra accurate processing, for example in a mentioned disturbance of a speed monitor and / or when an optional parking assistance function is performed. The data processor may be arranged to process signals related to optical measurement signals from a vehicle speed monitor, which optical measurement signals have been received by the vehicle via at least one said optical passage. The data processor may be adapted to use the optical signals to measure or estimate at least a distance between the vehicle and an object located in an environment of the vehicle. According to a further elaboration, the data processor may be adapted to process data using a neural network, so as to provide, for example, a self-learning data processor which during use adjusts the data processing on the basis of at least one prior data processing. In a further elaboration, the vehicle is provided with a system for receiving and transmitting optical signals, which system comprises: at least one receiver that can be installed in a vehicle for receiving optical signals; 7 - at least one transmitter, in particular laser, which is installable in the vehicle for transmitting optical signals; -a data processor installable in the vehicle, arranged for cooperation with said receiver and transmitter; One or more optical signal conductors, in particular optical fibers, which are installable in the vehicle for guiding optical signals incoming to the vehicle to said receiver and / or for guiding transmitted optical signals from said transmitter to a distance remote from said transmitter sender location. A said system for sending and receiving optical signals can, for example, already be built into a vehicle, or be retrofitted into a vehicle. By using said components, it is relatively simple to incorporate the system into the vehicle, preferably without having to adjust the vehicle. For example, it can be avoided that an exterior of the vehicle has to be provided with one or more optical transponders. Incoming signals can easily be introduced into the vehicle via the one or more optical signal conductors, to be detected by the one or more detectors. Optical signals to be transmitted can simply be guided via the one or more optical signal conductors from transmitting means (i.e. one or more light sources, e.g. a laser) located in the vehicle to an outside of the vehicle for transmission. According to a further elaboration, the data processor of the system is adapted to process signals which are related to optical measurement signals of a vehicle speed monitor detected by the receiver. In that case, the data processor may, for example, be configured to control said transmitter in such a way that interference signals are sent thereby to disturb the speed monitor. 8 In addition, the data processor may, for example, be adapted to use said signal conductors, transmitter and receiver in a distance measurement, for example to provide parking assistance. To this end, the transmitter can for example be controlled by the data processor to send at least one optical measurement signal, which measurement signal the vehicle is transmitted to a neighboring object. The receiver can be used to receive a reflection of the transmitted measurement signal from the object. Subsequently, the distance to the object can easily be determined or estimated by the data processor, at least by measuring or estimating the time period between transmission and reception of measurement signal and reflection, and for example a distance-dependent signal can be supplied. The invention further provides a method for receiving optical signals, using a vehicle according to the invention, the method comprising: transmission of at least a first optical signal incident on the vehicle from an environment via at least one elongated signal conductor to at least one signal processing unit installed in the vehicle. In this way, optical signals can be received reliably and without interference by the vehicle and the vehicle can be introduced to the receiver (which is preferably not directly visible from an environment of the vehicle). In an analogous manner, the invention provides a method for transmitting optical signals, using a vehicle according to the invention, the method comprising: - transmission of at least a second optical signal generated by at least one installed in the vehicle signal processing unit, via at least one elongated signal conductor 30 to an environment of the vehicle. 9 A combined method is provided with additional advantage, wherein the transmission of the first optical signals and the reception of the second optical signals are associated with each other. In particular, a data processor may be used to mutually associate transmission and reception of the signals. For example, a neural network can be used to associate the optical signals with each other. In addition, for example, predetermined data, for example data stored in a database, can be used to mutually associate the optical signals. Said first optical signals can for instance originate from a vehicle speed monitor, wherein the second optical signals are adapted to disturb the vehicle speed monitor. In another application, in particular a distance measurement, the first optical signals are reflections of the second optical signals. The present method preferably uses information which is related to a length of said optical signal conductor, in particular for the purpose of timing the optical signals (for example a correction with respect to an outside of the vehicle, at least a location of a respective optical passage). Further advantageous elaborations of the invention are described in the subclaims. The invention will now be elucidated on the basis of a non-limitative exemplary embodiment and the drawing. Therein: Figure 1 schematically shows a system according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention; Figure 2 is a part of the method shown in FIG. 1 system shown in more detail; Figure 3 shows an alternative elaboration of a part of the system; Figure 4 shows a further alternative elaboration of the system; 10 Figure 5 is a sectional view along line V-V of Figs. 4; and Figure 6 schematically a neural network. In this application, the same or corresponding measures are indicated by the same or corresponding reference numerals. Figure 1 shows a vehicle V provided at (i.e. in) a vehicle exterior 1 (e.g. entrance and / or exit windows) for passing through optical signals S1, S2 (the vehicle in and / or out). The vehicle is furthermore provided with elongated optical signal conductors 2, which extend between said passage 1 and an (in this case only one) optical signal processing unit U present in the vehicle. In this non-limitative example, the signal conductors 2 and signal processing unit U form a system for receiving and transmitting optical signals S 1, S 2. The system is already built into the vehicle V here; the schematic drawing in FIG. 1 15 is partially cut away to make the built-in system visible. Figure 2 shows an example of the system 2, U in more detail. In Fig. 1, the optical passages 1 are shown schematically and relatively large. In practice, one or more of these passages 1 can be relatively small with respect to the vehicle. Examples of suitable locations of such a passage, in particular for example at least a part of a gap or opening in an outside of the vehicle, have been mentioned above. Figure 2 shows a schematic cross-section of a said passage 1, wherein optical signals arriving at the passage from an environment O are drawn with arrow S1, and signals transmitted via the passage with arrows S2. The passage 1 extends through a vehicle part K, which for example defines a part of a vehicle exterior. The passage 1 can for instance be an opening, or a passage defined by a light-transmitting material (which material is in particular substantially transmissive for said optical signals S1, S2, 11, for example glass or a transparent plastic). Said passage 1 can for instance be provided with a watertight and / or airtight seal which transmits the signals S1, S2 (for example a suitable cap, plate or filling). In a further elaboration, the vehicle V is already provided with the one or more signal passages 1 when the system 2, U (for receiving and transmitting optical signals Si, S2) is built into the vehicle. In addition, one or more of the passages 1 can be provided in the vehicle V specifically for the passage of optical signals (to / from one or more respective elongated signal conductors 2). According to a further elaboration, a maximum transverse dimension W1, for example a height or diameter, of said optical passage 1 is smaller than approximately 1 cm, for example approximately 5 mm or smaller. A minimum transverse dimension W1 of such a passage can for instance amount to approximately 1 mm or more. A total surface area of at least one of said passages 1 measured in the cross-section (ie a cross-section normal with respect to a direction X shown in Fig. 2), for example of each signal passage 1, can for instance be a maximum of 1 cm 2, more in the in particular, for example, a maximum of 0.25 cm2. Said optical passage 2 may further have, for example, a length, measured in a direction X normal with respect to a local vehicle exterior, of, for example, less than 10 cm, for example a length in the range of approximately 1 mm - 5 cm, or a different length . In the present example the vehicle is provided with a number of locations (three, in this example) on a front side F, which optical passages 1, with respective signal conductors 2. The vehicle front side F is related to the forward main driving direction of the vehicle. A mutual distance between these front passage locations can for instance be at least approximately 10 cm or more. Incidentally, it is noted here that these front passages 1 can for instance be separate from each other, or form part of, for example, a gap or opening in the front of the vehicle V. Furthermore, the example is provided with an optical passage 1 at the rear of the vehicle. vehicle, to also receive and / or send optical signals there, using a respective signal conductor 2 and optical signal processor U. Preferably, the vehicle is (also) provided with at least one such optical passage in each side of the vehicle, to receive and / or send optical signals at the sides. A passage 1 for optical signals S1, S2 is in each case associated with one or more elongated, preferably flexible, optical signal conductor (s) 2 reaching the vehicle. 2, the signal conductor 2 can be provided with a first end, near or in the respective passage 1, for receiving environmental signals S1 which fall on the passage 1 and / or for passing via the passage 1 to the environment O of the vehicle V transmission of signals S2. Furthermore, the signal conductor 2 may be provided with a second end, which is coupled, for example, to the optical unit U, to exchange optical signals therewith. The signal conductors 2 can each in particular contain at least one optical fiber (for example glass fiber), can for instance have a length L of more than approximately 0.5 m, for example at least approximately 1 m. As already mentioned, shorter signal conductors can also 2, which inter alia depends on a distance to be bridged by said conductor 2 between the optical passage 2 and a processing unit U installed in the vehicle. In this example, the optical signal conductors 2 (preferably optical fibers 2) can be mounted on the vehicle. conducting incoming optical signals S1 to processing unit U, and sending signals S2 from processing unit U to environment O. The processing unit U is thus arranged at a distance from the optical passage (s) 1, is stable and at a safe location in the vehicle. As mentioned, advantageous 13 locations of the unit U include, for example, a passenger compartment, a dashboard, a center console next to the driver, an engine compartment, under a hood, and the like. Each signal conductor 2 can itself be designed in different ways. The signal conductor 2 can for instance comprise a flexible optical cable, provided with one or more optical fibers and a protective sheath. The light conductor 2 can be provided with a robust insulation, so that they are suitable for use in an engine compartment of a vehicle V. Preferably, each signal conductor 2 is provided with only one central optical fiber to offer an extra thin configuration, that is, not necessary. A maximum outer diameter of a said optical cable can, for example, be in the range of approximately 1 to 30 mm, or be of different dimensions. According to a further elaboration, the conductor 2 has a maximum outer dimension (e.g. diameter) of approximately 2 cm or less. One or more of the signal conductors 2 may, for example, each consist of a bare optical fiber, with a very small outer diameter (for example, a diameter of approximately 1 mm or smaller). Installation of a said optical signal conductor 2, in the vehicle V, can be carried out in various ways. Preferably, the conductor 2 is fixed to the vehicle at one or more locations by means of fixing means, for example using tape, Velcro, clamping means, kit, and / or the like, such that the conductor 2 is permanently positioned along a desired path ( and preferably at a distance from parts moving while driving). An end of a signal conductor 2 located at a said passage 1 can for instance be coupled to said passage 1 by means of a suitable (not shown) connector, for example a signal conductor connector extending through the passage 1, a vehicle part K adjacent to a 14 attached signal conductor connector, or otherwise. The present vehicle V is provided with an optical processing unit U, with a housing 7, which in particular has at least one receiver 3a for receiving optical signals S1 transmitted by one or more of the said signal conductors 2. In this case, the unit U is furthermore provided with a transmitter 3b for transmitting optical signals S2 via one or more of the said signal conductors 2. Said receiver 3a and transmitter 3b can each be designed in different ways, which will be clear to the skilled person. For example, an optical receiver 3a can comprise an image sensor, a photocell and / or be designed in a different way. Said transmitter 3b can in particular comprise one or more light sources. According to an additional advantageous elaboration, the transmitter 3b comprises a laser, for instance a semiconductor laser (e.g. one or more laser diodes). The transmitter 3b can, for example, be adapted to transmit infrared optical signals S2, at least signals S2 whose wavelength is only in the infrared spectrum, or other signals Said wavelength can for instance be in the range of approximately 850-1000 nm, for example 905 nm , or a different range. In this example, the receiver 3a can be arranged to detect incoming optical signals S1 which have a wavelength which is the same as a wavelength of signals S2 to be transmitted by the transmitter 3b. More in particular, the receiver 3a can be designed to detect infrared optical signals S1, at least signals S1 whose wavelength is in the range of approximately 850-1000 nm, for example 905 nm, or another range. In the case of the use of a separate transmitter 3a and receiver 3b, for example, processing of reception and transmission of optical signals 30 can be carried out simultaneously. It is then possible, for example, to separate the sensitive electronics of the receiver 3a from the electronics of the transmitter 3b, which benefits the sensitivity of the whole. The transmitter 3a and receiver 3b can jointly form an optical transceiver 3, which is shown in the example according to figures 4-5. Such a transceiver 3 can receive the optical signals S1 received via conductors 2, and signals S2 send in the conductors 2. In the case of such a combined transmitter / receiver 3, for example, a single light guide 2 is used for light transport in both directions. The reciprocating signals S1, S2 are then alternately processed. According to a further elaboration, the vehicle V is provided with at least two optical signal conductors 2, 2a which are associated with one optical receiver 3, 3a, such that optical signals S1 received via said signal conductors can be detected by said one receiver 3, 3a. Furthermore, the vehicle V can advantageously be provided with at least two optical signal conductors 2, 2b which are associated with one optical transmitter 3, 3b, such that optical signals S2 transmitted by said transmitter can be transmitted via the at least two optical signal conductors 2, 2b to be. Figure 5 shows a further elaboration, in which ends of different signal conductors 2 are bundled. Outer sides of the end parts of the conductors 2 can touch each other, for example, as in the drawing. The transceiver 3 is arranged to receive signals S1 from each of the conductors 2 separately, or to at least distinguish between the signals S1 incident from the various conductors 2. Furthermore, the transceiver 3 can be arranged, for example, to send the same signal S2 via the conductors 2, or to send mutually different signals S2 via the different conductors 2. It is noted that the information shown in FIG. 5 schematically shown arrangement, with a bundling of ends of signal conductors, can also be used in combination with a separate receiver 3a, wherein the receiver 3a is adapted to distinguish between the signals S1 incident from the various conductors 2a. Analogously, the method shown in FIG. 5 schematically shown arrangement, with a bundling of ends of signal conductors, can also be used in combination with a separate transmitter 3b, wherein the transmitter 3b can be adapted to send the same or just mutually different signals S2 to the respective conductors 2b. According to a further elaboration, for example a series of micro-lenses can be used to efficiently couple light from one transmitter 3b (for example a laser diode) into different signal conductor fibers 2b. It will be clear that the light from one transmitter 3b (for example a laser diode) can also be coupled in different signal conductor fibers 2b without the use of micro lenses. It will furthermore be clear that an optical coupling between a signal conductor 2 on the one hand and transmitter 3a and receiver 3b (or alternatively transceiver 3) can be carried out in different ways, whether or not using one or more optical elements, for example lenses and / or mirrors and / or filters. Furthermore, the housing 7 of the optical processing unit U are provided with one or more optical connection ports P for connecting said one or more optical signal conductors 2, for example releasably. Each connection port of the housing 7 can be associated with (and optionally form part of) a transmitter 3a and / or receiver 3b, for sending and / or receiving signals to / from a signal conductor 2 connected to that connection port. As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 in more detail, said optical passage 1 may be associated, for example, with at least a first optical signal conductor 2a for transmitting received 17 signals S1, and at least a second optical signal conductor 2b for transmitting signals S2 to be transmitted. Fig. 4 shows an additional advantageous embodiment, wherein an optical passage 1 is associated with a single optical signal conductor 2 which serves both for transmission of the received optical signals S1 and for transmission of optical signals S2 to be transmitted (transmitted by transceiver 3). Preferably, one or more optical means are used to increase an aperture angle cp for receiving optical signals S1 at an optical passage 1. Examples of said opening angle are schematically drawn with angles cp in Figure 1. The opening angle cp may be substantially the same angle for each of the different passages 1, or may comprise mutually different opening angles. The opening angle cp is in particular greater than approximately 10 degrees, more in particular greater than approximately 20 degrees, more in particular at least 30 degrees. Said optical means (ie an ""opening angle magnifier"") can for instance comprise a reflector and / or a lens which is arranged in or near the optical passage 1, such that signals S1 received within the desired opening angle are thus in an end therewith of an optical signal conductor 2. The present figures show in particular application of (positive) lenses 11, 11a arranged in / near the passages 1 to enlarge said opening angle cp (and for optical coupling of the respective one or more signal conductors). A diameter of each lens 11, 11a may, for example, be equal to or smaller than a said maximum transverse dimension W1 of the respective optical passage 1. According to a further elaboration, each lens 11, 11a has a diameter in the range of approximately 1- 20 mm, for example (but not limited to) a diameter that is smaller than approximately 5 mm. 18 Incidentally, such a lens 11, 11a can be arranged at different locations, for example in the passage 1, outside (ie on a vehicle exterior) or just behind the passage 1 in the vehicle V. Further, for example, each time a lens system can be of at least two lenses. 5 provided for increasing the said opening angle <p. Furthermore, the lens 11, 11a may per se form a water-tight and / or airtight seal of a respective optical passage 1 (i.e. without a visible gap between the lens and a vehicle edge / side surrounding the passage visible in Figures 2-4). The lens 11, 11a can further offer protection to a signal conductor 2 arranged behind it. It is noted that said lens 11, 11a is selected per desired situation, in particular with regard to an opening angle and / or diameter. Said lens may, for example, have a fixed or variable focal length. Moreover, in the example, optical means (in this example, again lenses 11, 11b) are provided to increase the opening angle of signals S2 to be transmitted via a passage 1. An opening angle for transmitting signals S2 can for instance be equal to a said opening angle cp for include receiving signals S1 or another angle. It will be clear that the means 11, 11a, 11b for increasing the opening angle cp can be mounted in various ways. The means 11, 11a, 11b can be positioned, for example, at a fixed position relative to a nearby end of a respective optical signal conductor 2, and fixed to the signal conductor 2, for example, by means of a connection or coupling. According to an additional advantageous elaboration, these means 11, 11a, 11b are already coupled to or associated with an associated signal conductor 2 before the conductor 2 is installed in the vehicle, so that relatively fast and simple installation is possible. 19 The embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is provided with separate aperture magnifiers 11a, 11b for the optical conductors 2a, 2b for transmitting and receiving signals. An extra compact configuration is shown in FIG. 3, wherein an opening angle enlarger 11 is associated with both a first signal conductor 2a (for transmission of incoming signals S1) and a second signal conductor 2b (for transmission of signals S2 to be transmitted). In Fig. 4, the same opening angle magnifier 11 serves to increase the opening angle for receiving signals S1 as for increasing the opening angle for transmitting signals S2, by being associated with the signal conductor 2. Preferably, one or more optical filters are used to filter received signals S1. Such a filter may, for example, form part of said optical means 11, 11a, 11b for enlarging an opening angle, and / or may be designed otherwise. In addition, such a filter can for instance form part of a said receiver 3a, 3, or be arranged between the receiver and an associated signal conductor 2a, 2. Furthermore, such a filter can for instance be combined with an optional water-tight and / or airtight seal of an optical passage 1. More particularly, said filter can be arranged to substantially transmit light within a predetermined wavelength range, and to allow light to pass through. substantially not allowing beyond that wavelength range (for example, to absorb and / or reflect). In the examples, the optical processing unit U is provided with a data processor 4, which is adapted to process data related to said optical signals S1, S2. Said data comprise, for example, data generated by a said receiver 3a, 3, for example electrical measurement signals, concerning receipt of the one or more optical signals S1. The data furthermore comprise, for example, control signals for controlling a said transmitter 3b, 3, for the purpose of transmitting the one or more optical signals S2. The data processor 4 preferably has information which is related to a length L of said optical signal conductor 2, 2a, 2b. Such information may include, for example, the physical length L of the signal conductor, or an optical path length of light passed through that conductor, or an amount of time that light requires to pass through the conductor, or other information. The data processor 4 can use this information with great advantage in processing information regarding optical signals S1, S2 to be transmitted and / or received. In particular, said conductor length information can be used by the data processor 4 to accurately determine a moment when a signal S1 was received in the optical passage 1, before the signal S1 was transmitted from a conductor 2, 2a to a receiver 3, 3a led. The data processor 4 can apply a first time correction to a detection moment, concerning a detection of the signal S1 carried out by a receiver 3, 3a, which first correction is proportional to the length L of the respective optical signal conductor 2, 2a 20 (e.g. comprising a time correction this length L divided by the speed of light). A reception time at the optical passage 1 is then equal to the detection time at the receiver minus the first time correction. In the same way, said conductor length information can be used by the data processor 4 to accurately determine a moment when a signal S2 is to be transmitted from the optical passage 1, taking into account the time that the signal S2 will need to run through the signal conductor 2, 2b from a transmitter 3, 3b. The data processor 4 can apply a second time correction to a transmission moment, concerning a transmission carried out by a transmitter 3, 3b, the signal S2, which second correction is proportional to the length L of the respective optical signal conductor 2, 2b (e.g. comprising a time correction this length L divided by the speed of light). A transmission time at the optical passage 1 is then equal to the transmission time at the transmitter plus the second time correction. Furthermore, the system may be, for example, of a suitable power supply 5 for feeding, for example, the parts of the unit U. The power supply 5 may, for example, comprise a battery power supply, an external power supply, and / or be designed in a different way. According to a further elaboration, the power supply 5 may comprise a power supply connection with a relatively wide input voltage range. The unit U can thus be connectable, for example, to a portable battery, but also to a car battery or an external mains adapter, which increases the field of application. The system can further be provided with a user interface 6, which can be designed in various ways. The interface 6 may, for example, be wholly or partly combined with the unit U, or be arranged completely or partially remotely therefrom and then be coupled to the unit U, for example via a suitable wired or wireless connection. The interface 6 may, for example, comprise a control panel, be provided with touch keys, push buttons, make use of voice control, be provided with a display, for example a touch-sensitive screen, be provided with a data transfer port (for example for connecting a data carrier) and / or of such. The interface 6 can, for example, use graphic light symbols and / or sound signals to signal a user (in particular a driver of the vehicle V). According to an additional special elaboration, the data processor 4 is adapted to process signals which are related to optical measurement signals S1 from a vehicle speed monitor (not shown in itself), which optical measurement signals S1 are received via at least one said optical passage 1. In that case, the data processor 4 can, for example, warn a user that such signals S1 have been received. In addition, the data processor 4 may, for example, be adapted to send interference signals S2. Optical interference signals S2 to be transmitted can be assembled in various ways, which will be clear to the skilled person. Preferably, interference signals S2 to be transmitted are dependent on observed measurement signals S1, such that a good malfunction of the monitor can be achieved and, for example, such that the monitor does not realize that it is disturbed (""stealth""). In addition, the data processor 4 can for instance be arranged to use the optical signals for measuring or estimating at least a distance between the vehicle and an object located in an environment of the vehicle (for example a wall, sidewalk, another vehicle, a person and / or the like). A result of such a measurement / estimate can be transmitted via said interface 6 to the driver of the vehicle V. The data processor 4 can thus, for example, offer a parking assistance function, or be part of an adaptive cruise control system, or both. Another function to be performed by the data processor 4 may comprise, for example, a remote control, for example for operating a gate or garage door. In that case, the data processor 4 is adapted to send remote control signals S2 which are suitable for controlling a unit to be operated (for example, an actuator to move a gate or door). Yet another function comprises, for example, remote control for unlocking the vehicle V, and / or for activating vehicle accessories. In that case, one or more first signals S1 can be sent to the vehicle V by an external remote control, which signals S1 are received via a said optical passage (s) 1 and signal conductor (s) 2, and are received by the receiver 3 detected. Depending on the received signal S1, the data processor 4 can take an associated action (i.e. vehicle unlocking and / or activation of one or more vehicle accessories). Still another function comprises a ""Pedestrian avoidance system"", 5 in which the data processor 4 can use the signals to detect pedestrians in the vicinity of the vehicle V, and can take action on detection (such as warning the driver, or the vehicle) have a braking action or evasive maneuver carried out). Furthermore, the data processor 4 may be adapted, for example, to supply a vehicle number plate shield by having signals S2 sent during activation during a certain protection period which render legibility of a vehicle number plate impossible. Yet another optionally executable function of the system comprises a blind spot / blind spot detection, wherein one or more optical passages 1 are positioned to receive optical signals from an area which area is not directly visible to a driver of the vehicle V . The data processor 4 can for instance be designed to perform only one of the above-mentioned tasks / functions, or to perform at least two of the above-mentioned tasks. The data processor 4 may, for example, be switchable in different modes via the interface 6 to perform the various functions available. It is noted that during use, for example, predetermined data, for example data stored in a database, can be used to mutually associate the optical signals S1, S2. An additional advantageous further elaboration comprises the use of a neural network N to mutually associate such optical signals S1, S2. According to a further elaboration, the data processor 4 may be adapted to process said data using a neural network N. The neural network N may, for example, form part of a data processing performed by the data processor 4, the neural network N being a learning process. (training) before the data processor is installed in vehicle V. In particular, the data processor 4 may be programmed (or provided with appropriate software) to form the neural network N. Neural networks are known per se. Figure 6 schematically shows an example of a known neural network N. The network N comprises a number of layers of neurons M. In this example, each neuron M from a certain layer has a connection with all neurons M from the layer before (said connections are with arrows shown in Fig. 6). Every connection has a specific transfer function. The sum of all input values times their transfer function determines characters the value of the neuron itself. The transfer function indicates the 'weight' of the connection 15, how strong the signal arrives at the target neuron via that connection, and can be positive (stimulating) or negative (inhibiting). The neural network can use stored information and can acquire knowledge during use. In particular, the network N can be trained by repeatedly presenting input values with associated desired output values, and by adjusting the transfer functions based on those values. The use of such a network N is expected to be particularly advantageous in recognizing a vehicle speed monitor. In particular, the network N may be adapted to analyze data patterns of different types of vehicle speed monitors, and to base signals S2 to be transmitted on those data patterns. A neural network N, for example, is ideal for real-time pattern recognition. It is therefore expected that such a network N will be particularly well able to recognize recognizable patterns of vehicle speed monitors, and to respond adaptively to a vehicle speed monitor that transmits signals S1 with random patterns. Training of the network N may, for example, include: offering network input values related to signals S1 transmitted by a known type of vehicle speed monitor, with associated desired network output values related to desired optical (interference) signals S2 to be transmitted. This training can be performed for all available vehicle speed monitor types. Said network input values can for instance comprise a strength of a received signal S1, and a duration and mutual duration of signal parts. As mentioned, the present invention offers a large number of examples. When relatively thin flexible conductors 2 are used, it is possible to place optical passages 1 (e.g. detection openings) at locations which are difficult to reach on a front and / or rear of a vehicle V. Furthermore, the optical conductors 2 make it possible that associated electronics (the unit U) do not have to be placed in a vehicle engine compartment, so that the electronics can therefore be made more economically. The conductors 2 make it possible for the vehicle V to be simple or provided with a plurality of optical passages 1, for example to increase the detectability of an external light source. The replacement of a conductor 2 (for example with a lens system) can be carried out quickly and easily without adjusting the electronics. It goes without saying that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment described. Various changes are possible within the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. For example, the term ""one"" in this application may mean only one, at least one, or a number. 26 Furthermore, a said system can easily be installed in different types of vehicles, for instance comprising a motor vehicle, car, motorcycle, truck, a part of a motor vehicle, a trailer pulled by a motor vehicle, for example a trailer or caravan, and / or a combination thereof. In addition, it will be clear that a vehicle can also be provided with an optical passage located at a vehicle exterior for transmission of optical signals, and an associated elongated optical signal conductor 2, which is situated between said passage 1 and at least one in the vehicle. optical signal processing unit U, without application of a said transmitter or receiver. Furthermore, the system can for instance be of modular design, for instance such that it can easily be expanded by adding one or more optical signal conductors. Furthermore, a length of an optical signal conductor can for instance be easily adapted to an available installation length. If a length of an optical signal conductor is changed, it is preferable that the data processor 4 is provided with new (optional) information which is related to the length of the new optical signal conductor 20 (for example using the interface 6)."
3497,US-8706758-B2,Flexible account reconciliation ,2011,"Disclosed are improvements to a method for account reconciliation comprising improved, extended, and more flexible algorithms for (1) automatically determining what transaction features are best candidates for matching diverse datasets; (2) automatically determining how logically to subdivide accounting datasets prior to reconciliation; (3) matching groups of transactions (allowing one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many matches instead of just one-to-one matches); (4) making use of more types of transaction feature, including transaction dates (where proximity of two transactions in date may be significant even if the dates do not exactly match). The improved method is, therefore, better able to perform its intended function of identifying matching transactions. It is applicable to a wider class of problems while still saving significant costs and labor, and still retaining flexibility in not requiring source data in a particular format, and not being domain-dependent or requiring extensive user setup."
3498,US-10417702-B2,Dynamically providing a third-party checkout option ,2011,"Methods for facilitating financial transactions include facilitating or otherwise increasing the ease and speed of checkout processes. In particular, one or more implementations comprise an e-commerce payment facilitator that acts as an intermediary between a commerce application and a payment gateway. The e-commerce payment facilitator can provide stored payment information to a commerce application based on a few simple selections by a user. This allows a user to easily and securely complete commerce transactions, which simplifies the user's checkout experience and reduces barriers to purchase. Furthermore, the e-commerce payment facilitator can pass payment details to the commerce application's payment gateway. In addition to the foregoing, methods involve dynamically and intelligently providing a user the option of using payment information stored by the network application."

According to one embodiment, locating and tracking a mobile device can comprise reading sensor data from each of a plurality of sensors within the mobile device. The sensors can provide the sensor data without relying on a signal from a device external to the mobile device. For example, the plurality of sensors can comprise a compass, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer. Motion, velocity, and heading of the mobile device can be determined based on the sensor data."
3500,US-9934361-B2,Method for generating healthcare-related validated prediction models from multiple sources ,2011,"Provided is a method for generating prediction models from multiple healthcare centers. The method allows a third party to use data sets from multiple sources to build prediction models. By entering the data sets in a Model Deconstruction and Transfer (MDT) platform, a healthcare center may provide data to a third party without the need to de-identify data or to physically transfer any identifying or de-identified data from the healthcare center. The MDT platform includes a variable library, which allows the healthcare center to select variables that will be used to generate and validate the prediction model. Also provided is a method for compensating sources that contribute data sets based upon the percentage of clinical data that is used to generate a prediction model."
