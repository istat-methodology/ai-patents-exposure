Maintaining wireless fingerprints in this way provides a reliable and low latency mechanism for performing map-related operations."
5993,US-11694813-B2,Left ventricular volume and cardiac output estimation using machine learning model ,2019,"Methods and systems are disclosed for creating and using a neural network model to estimate a cardiac parameter of a patient, and using the estimated parameter in providing blood pump support to improve patient cardiac performance and heart health. Particular adaptations include adjusting blood pump parameters and determining whether and how to increase or decrease support, or wean the patient from the blood pump altogether. The model is created based on neural network processing of data from a first patient set and includes measured hemodynamic and pump parameters compared to a cardiac parameter measured in situ, for example the left ventricular volume measured by millar (in animals) or inca (in human) catheter. After development of a model based on the first set of patients, the model is applied to a patient in a second set to estimate the cardiac parameter without use of an additional catheter or direct measurement."
5994,US-11790596-B2,Bayesian machine learning system for adaptive ray-tracing ,2019,"Various techniques for adaptive rendering of images with noise reduction are described. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to approaches for rendering and denoising images—such as ray-traced images—in an iterative process that distributes computational efforts to pixels where denoised output is predicted with higher uncertainty. In some embodiments, an input image may be fed into a deep neural network (DNN) to jointly predict a denoised image and an uncertainty map. The uncertainty map may be used to create a distribution of additional samples (e.g., for one or more samples per pixel on average), and the additional samples may be used with the input image to adaptively render a higher quality image. This process may be repeated in a loop, until some criterion is satisfied, for example, when the denoised image converges to a designated quality, a time or sampling budget is satisfied, or otherwise."
5995,US-11660692-B2,Thermal displacement compensator ,2019,"A thermal displacement compensator measures a temperature of an environment in which a machine is installed and a temperature of each part of the machine, and calculates a temperature difference between at least two temperatures among measured temperatures. Furthermore, the thermal displacement amount of the machine is acquired. Then, based on teacher data using the measured temperatures and the calculated temperature difference as input data and using the acquired thermal displacement amount as output data, a thermal displacement compensation model that estimates the output data from the input data is created by machine learning."
5996,US-11200689-B1,Detailed 3D estimation from a single image ,2019,"A system configured to perform an accurate and fast estimation of an object shape from a single input image. The system may process image data representing a first surface of an object using image-to-image translation techniques. A first trained model may generate depth information for the object, such as front distance estimates and back distance estimates. The system may use the depth information to generate an output mesh shaped like the object, such as, in the case of a pliable object a reposable avatar. The system may improve depth estimation by including a loss on surface normals in the first trained model. A second trained model may generate color information to be applied to the output mesh to accurately represent the object. The output mesh may include detailed geometry and appearance of the object, useful for a variety of purposes such as gaming, virtual/augmented reality, virtual shopping, and other implementations."
5997,US-11562245-B2,Neural network model generation and distribution with client feedback ,2019,"Technologies described herein can be used to generate and distribute neural network models and executable code using feedback data received from one or more client computing devices. A neural network model can be generated by a server computer. Executable code can also be generated by the server that, when executed by a client computing device, causes the client device to generate a prediction using the neural network model. The server can transmit the model and code to one or more client computing devices. The server can receive feedback data from the client device(s) based on predictions generated by the client device(s) using the neural network model and the executable code. The server can generate an updated version of the neural network model and/or an updated version of the executable code base on the feedback data, and can transmit the updated model and/or the updated code to the client device(s)."

5999,US-12072439-B2,"Synthetic generation of radar, LIDAR and ultrasound measurement data ",2019,"A method for generating synthetic measurement data indistinguishable from actual measurement data captured by a first physical measurement modality. The first physical measurement modality is based on emitting an interrogating wave towards an object and recording a reflected wave coming from the object in a manner that allows for a determination of the time-of-flight between the emission of the interrogating beam and the arrival of the reflected wave. The method includes: obtaining a first compressed representation of the synthetic measurement data in a first latent space, wherein this first latent space is associated with a first decoder that is trained to map each element of the first latent space to a record of synthetic measurement data that is indistinguishable from records of actual measurement data of the first physical measurement modality, and applying the first decoder to the first compressed representation, so as to obtain the sought synthetic measurement data."
