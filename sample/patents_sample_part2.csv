US-8712927-B2;Systems and methods for parameter adaptation ;2008;A method of parameter adaptation is used to modify the parameters of a model to improve model performance. The model separately estimates the contribution of each model parameter to the prediction error. It achieves this by transforming to the time-scale plane the vectors of output sensitivities with respect to model parameters and then identifying the regions within the time-scale plane at which the dynamic effect of individual model parameters is dominant on the output. The method then attributes the prediction error in these regions to the deviation of a single parameter from its true value as the basis of estimating individual parametric errors. The proposed Parameter Signature Isolation Method (PARSIM) then uses these estimates to adapt individual model parameters independently of the others, implementing, in effect, concurrent adaptation of individual parameters by the Newton-Raphson method in the time-scale plane.

US-8055078-B2;Filter for blocking image-based spam ;2008;A network device and method are directed towards detecting and blocking image spam within a message by employing a weighted min-hash to perform a near duplicate detection (NDD) of determined features within an image as compared to known spam images. The weighting for the min-hash is determined based on employing a machine learning algorithm, such as a perceptron, to identify an importance of each bit in a signature vector of the image. The signature vector is generated by extracting a shape of text in the image using a Discrete Cosine Transform, extracting low-frequency characteristics using a high-pass filter, and then performing various morphological operations to emphasize the shape of the text and reduce noise. Selected feature bits are extracted from the lowest frequency and intensity bits of the resulting signal to generate the signature vector used in the weighted min-hash NDD.

US-9002678-B1;Unified approach to detection and isolation of parametric faults using a kalman filter residual-based approach ;2014;A unified method to detection and isolation of parametric faults in a physical system resulting from variations in the parameters of its constituting subsystems, termed herein as diagnostic parameters, uses Kalman filter residuals. Rather than using the feature vector made of the coefficients of the numerator and denominator of the system transfer function, which is known to be a non-linear function of the diagnostic parameter variations, the method first shows and then exploits, for fault detection purposes, the fact that the Kalman filter residual is a multi-linear function of the deviations in the diagnostic parameters, i.e. the residual is separately linear in each parameter. A fault is then isolated using a Bayesian multiple composite hypotheses testing approach. A reliable map relating the diagnostic parameters to the residual is obtained off-line using fault emulators. The unified fault detection and isolation method is successfully evaluated on both simulated data as well as on real data obtained from a benchmarked laboratory-scale coupled-tank system used to exemplify an industrial two-tank process.

US-10778628-B2;Predictive scoring and messaging in messaging systems ;2016;A method for improving mass messaging in an electronic messaging system includes receiving recipient data describing a response of each of one or more recipients to receiving a prior message, generating predictor data based on the recipient data, where the predictor data indicates a plurality of predictors of recipient behavior in response to a message, identifying one or more top predictors of recipient behavior, the one or more top predictors being selected from among the plurality of predictors based on preferred recipient behaviors, generating, for each of the one or more recipients and from the recipient data, one or more predictive scores for each combination of top predictor and recipient, and assigning, based on one or more predictive scores of a specific recipient, the specific recipient to a specific persona, wherein the specific persona describes an expected behavior of the recipient.
US-11120584-B2;System and method for removing Gibbs artifact in medical imaging system ;2016;The present disclosure is related to systems and methods for image processing. The method may include obtaining a first set of image data. The method may also include generating a second set of image data by processing, based on a trained machine learning model, the first set of image data. The second set of image data may have a relatively high resolution and/or a relatively low level of artifacts with respect to the first set of image data. The method may further include generating a target image by performing a weighted fusion on the first set of image data and the second set of image data.
US-10437957-B2;Driving patient campaign based on trend patterns in patient registry information ;2016;A medical campaign method, computer program product, and system are provided. A patient registry record in a patient registry is analyzed to identify at least one trend of a clinical measure for a corresponding patient and correlate the at least one trend with one or more medical campaigns directed to improving the clinical measure. A medical campaign is selected from the one or more medical campaigns for application to the patient. The medical campaign is executed to apply the medical campaign to the patient. Executing the medical campaign involves sending a communication to a communication device associated with the patient.
US-10075463-B2;Bot detection system based on deep learning ;2016;A system automatically detects bots and/or botnets.
US-10055652-B2;Pedestrian detection and motion prediction with rear-facing camera ;2016;Systems, methods, and devices for pedestrian detection are disclosed herein. A method includes receiving one or more images from a rear-facing camera on a vehicle. The method further includes determining that a pedestrian is present in the one or more images, predicting future motion of the pedestrian, and notifying a driver-assistance or automated driving system when a conflict exists between forward motion of the vehicle and the predicted future motion of the pedestrian.
US-11819321-B2;System and method for monitoring airflow in a subject's airway with ultrasound ;2016;Described here are systems and methods for monitoring airflow changes in a patient's airway during a medical procedure or as a general patient monitoring tool. Doppler ultrasound signals are acquired from an anatomical region within the patient's airway (e.g., a tracheal wall, a cricothyroid ligament, other connective or cartilaginous tissue within the trachea, larynx, or pharynx) and parameters from those Doppler ultrasound signals are compared to baseline parameters, which may include inputting Doppler ultrasound signals to a suitably trained deep learning model or other machine learning algorithm. When a threshold change is detected, an alarm can be provided to a user to indicate respiratory compromise and/or failure, which can include early airway compromise, airway failure, and/or airway obstruction.
US-11610100-B2;Accelerator for deep neural networks ;2016;A system for bit-serial computation in a neural network is described. The system may be embodied on an integrated circuit and include one or more bit-serial tiles for performing bit-serial computations in which each bit-serial tile receives input neurons and synapses, and communicates output neurons. Also included is an activation memory for storing the neurons and a dispatcher and a reducer. The dispatcher reads neurons and synapses from memory and communicates either the neurons or the synapses bit-serially to the one or more bit-serial tiles. The other of the neurons or the synapses are communicated bit-parallelly to the one or more bit-serial tiles, or according to a further embodiment, may also be communicated bit-serially to the one or more bit-serial tiles. The reducer receives the output neurons from the one or more tiles, and communicates the output neurons to the activation memory.
US-10169295-B2;Convolution operation device and method ;2016;"A convolution operation method includes the following steps of: performing convolution operations for data inputted in channels, respectively, so as to output a plurality of convolution results; and alternately summing the convolution results of the channels in order so as to output a sum result. A convolution operation device executing the convolution operation method is also disclosed."
